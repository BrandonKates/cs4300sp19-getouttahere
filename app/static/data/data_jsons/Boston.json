Yes, the burger comes wrapped in paper, but because the burger itself is rather small and dense, the wrapping does less to keep one's hands clean than to get in one's way while trying to eat it.\n\nI ordered the mushroom Swiss burger, which was tasty enough, though the mushrooms were cold.  And I mean, straight-out-of-the-refrigerator cold, which was an unpleasant contrast to the warm bun, hot patty, sauteed onions, and melted Swiss.  Yes, the burger tasted somewhat more \"fresh\" and homemade than other fast food burgers, but then, that's not really what a fast food burger is about.\n\nAnyway, this place caters to a crowd that wants to feel that they are eating healthy/healthier options and I think B.

You clear security here for tours of the historic USS Constitution warship. There is useful information and displays regarding the The vessel at the visitor centre as well as a gift shop if interested to by a souvenir. \n\nYou will find an even better USS Constitution Museum further down the navy yard. It is very much worth spending some time at the is family-friendly museum before or after touring the historic vessel. \n\nAt the Navy Yard, you can also board the Fletcher class destroyer, USS Cassin Young, which is docked here. This ship saw action in the Pacific during WWII and is available for self-guided touring. Another nice attraction to look out for is the early 19th century Commandant's House perched on a hill just above the navy yard. \n\nSome of the key buildings and machinery around the navy yard have been left for you to see and there are plenty of information signs throughout. These are very helpful if you are unfamiliar with shipyards. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed our stop at the Charlestown Navy Yard, finding this a nice place to spend a couple hours as part of our visit of the Boston Freedom Trail.

This elegant dining establishment situated right on the water features wonderful views of the harbor, spectacular service, and amazing menu selection. I came here for NYE, and had all my expectations met, with some even being exceeded! Course timing was perfect, and the ambiance was both intimate and welcoming. Those who are searching for a taste of the best of Boston need not look any further.\n\nIf this was helpful, please consider a thumbs up. It would be greatly-appreciated!", "time": 1546329886}]}, "status": "OK"}, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Good Life": {"type": "drink", "description": ["good", "life", "hidden", "gem", "located",

I waited about 20-25 minutes and was able to get seated. I was by myself and so was the man standing behind me so they asked if we wouldn't mind sitting together and we both agreed. I am glad we did as we had an excellent time and great conversation as we both had a lot in common. I had the Frutti Di Mare with the Giacomo sauce which was excellent. The man I was eating with had the Veal Marsala and said his was very good. The bread was also very good and fresh baked.
