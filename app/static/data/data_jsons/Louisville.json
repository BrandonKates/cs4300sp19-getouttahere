I experienced more friendliness in the first thirty seconds here than I have ever experienced in a collective weeks worth of dining.  On multiple visits now, the place has been nothing less than perfect.\n\nFood:  Good BBQ grub.  The slices of sweet and spicy pickles that accompany many of the sandwiches are killer.... love them!  Overall, some sides taste \"from the can\" while others taste totally homemade (best collard greens I've ever tasted!).\n\nI completely recommend this place.
