The waiter asked, right off the bat, if we wanted separate checks - which was nice because we did.  The cafe wasn't too busy, it was a little after 7 PM, so there was no waiting.\nI had the 5-way Chili Mac with Veggie Chili and a Diet Coke.  They started us out with corn bread after serving us our drinks and our food was served pretty quickly and was tasty.  Afterwards, even though I shouldn't have, I ordered a Reese's Peanut Butter Pie.  To be honest I was full but the dessert menu looked so good!  And the pie was perfect - with whipped cream and some chocolate syrup. \nOverall the price wasn't that bad either, even including the tip.  I have to say the Hard Times Cafe is one of those places where you CAN visit it a few times a season without worrying about your wallet and just enjoy the food.  Also, it is far enough away from the Waterfront NOT to be too crowded or filled with tourists.  But it also means it is close to the King Street Station when you need to get back home via one of the buses or the subway.  As we all had to get home via public transport it was nice that we were served so quickly and were so close to the station.  Yet, we never felt rushed!

We waited almost 15 minutes just to get menus. We didn't get our drinks for 20 more minutes.  We were at the restaurant for over an hour before we got our food. A couple that was there before us actually left without eating because of the wait. The food was OK. The potatoes were under cooked and very greasy. The brie appetizer was delicious but being that all they did was heat it up and drip some honey on it, I can't really give them props for that. My husbands vegetable frittata had good flavor but was a bit under cooked. I had a steak and cheese omelet. A bit on the greasy side but decent flavor. Needless to say, we won't be going back but I hope they get their act together and are able to handle the people who do show up, otherwise they won't stay in business long.
