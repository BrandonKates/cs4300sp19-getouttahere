                "text": "Gorgeous building! I didn't have any unexpected fees for anything. The Florida Theatre website informs that there are parking garages and gives you the prices/ price ranges and their distance from the theatre for each one. We went to see Aaron Lewis, one of my all time favorite artists! The show was amazing, except everyone sitting in the rows in front of us (all 49 rows) wouldn't stay seated. They kept getting up and down, usually 5 or more people would leave a row to get a drink, they'd come back, then another group of 4 would get up and all leave to get their drinks...it was an on going thing without a break from start to finish. And you know when one person has to leave a row, then everyone else in that row needs to stand up to let them out. This made for my experience a little unpleasant. I couldn't enjoy or even see most of the show. It's not the venues fault, but it is something that may need to be fixed eventually. Maybe getting servers...honestly, anything to help keep the guests in their seats would make it an even better experience. I enjoyed how fast they got everyone in, even while wanding all guest and their purses. The guests constantly getting up and standing in front, without a care in the world was my only bad thing to say.",

Outdoor seating is nice, right along the sidewalk, and the vantage point actually makes it feel like you\u2019re in a real city! Cafe inside is cozy. Staff is friendly. Only issue I can find is the presence of homeless people. They keep to themselves for the most part but the park across the street attracts a lot of them so just be aware. This is a nice addition to the bookstore of theirs south of downtown since that one is without a cafe. And with the holidays around the corner it\u2019s quite festive!",

The second one I think is a side effect of being located around the Hemming park and honestly the cafe owners are doing their best to make the situation better.

My Husband chose the stuffed chicken and it was moist and juicy.  The Calamari was sweet paired nicely with my sweet Moscato wine. 1st time at Ruth Chris and we will definitely be back for our Anniversary in June.

I really shouldn't say that....Frank and I go there three or four times a year.\nI'm not a steak eater, as I have said before, but even I can tell that the steaks at Ruth's Chris are in a catagory all their own.  The steaks are aged to perfection, then they are seared over a flame,\nfrom that point they are plated and finished cooking and properly rested before being placed in front of you.....and if you don't start salivating immediately I would be very surprised!\nWhen you order sides they are meant to be shared.  So if you go in as a couple, two sides will be more than enough.  Ruth's Chris offers a good selection of sides.  I will tell you that if you like Sweet Potatoes, make sure you order the Sweet Potato Casserole....I have seen people order it for dessert!  Yes, it's that good!!!  They don't always offer Onion Rings, but if they do have them on the menu, they are worth ordering as well.\nWhen you call to make reservations make sure you let them know if it's for a celebration.  Birthdays and Anniversaries are always treated special if they know ahead of time.  Your table will be decorated and after your meal they offer a free dessert.  \nThis is a pricey restaurant, be prepared to drop between $100-150 for two people. For a special dinner out, I know you won't be disappointed.",

Upon arriving to the restaurant, the first surprise was that the menu was nothing like the menu that we saw online - different dishes with steeper prices. Boyfriend and I ordered two small plates for starters - the pear and date dish and the meatball dish. We were shocked when the plates came out and there were literally like 4 meatballs? The pear dish was so small we literally had a bite each. The concept of tapas is to share and that was Barely enough food for one person to sample. The food tasted great but That sad appetizer and what must have been a 3 oz glass of wine cost us around $40. We ended up going to burrito gallery after because we were both still starving. Very disappointed. Save your money and go somewhere else.",
