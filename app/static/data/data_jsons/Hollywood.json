Once on the tour, there is not much to see that you can't see from the street. The history lesson was appropriate, but again, not much to see as he was showing movie clips on his iPad. There appeared to be just one street set, which was in use filming (which was kinda cool). We stopped at a prop room that was quite small but did have some Star Trek props, which I appreciated.

BUT, I was pleasantly surprised!  This was done very well, with some really good figures.  The rules are \"don't touch the hands or the face\", but they have multiple places you can dress or hold props, or be part of the \"scene\" being depicted for photos, so that makes it more fun.  They've got a good mix of new and old, male and female...and alien...and horror characters and monsters, etc. Speaking of, the one thing I'd recommend is a way to bypass entirely the \"horror movie\" figures.  I'm sure I'm not alone in this - I have a daughter that's old enough that she knows many of the figures, but still young enough that they really scare her.  After some prodding and pushing, I got her to hold my hand, stare at the stairs and floor and run through the \"dungeon scene\".   That being said, I don't know if that would even be possible, but the only other option would be to go back out the way we came, and then see if they'd let us go backward into the end of the museum.  There may not be any way to arrange it differently. Overall, it was a fun experience, and the \"combo ticket\" which includes the \"Castle of Chaos\" (interactive 4d movie/ride thing), the mini-golf, and the mirror maze, was well worth the cost of admission.", "time": 1554949537}, {"author_name": "Megan Allen", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102275029124203796924/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2MwmYnvMxHk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHqU/aEU0BNVrrCU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 weeks ago", "text": "Been here a lot.
