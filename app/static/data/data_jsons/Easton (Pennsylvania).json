Some days they have the photos available to purchase, others they don\u2019t. There\u2019s lockers and coat racks for storage and a place to eat with a frequent show for entertainment at certain hours. The second floor has a lot of activities. Wax hand making is a new feature on the third floor and a huge gymnasium for kids to climb up and view the fourth floor. A toddler corner sets on the second floor. There\u2019s lots to do, you\u2019ll have fun and as a fellow parent, being patient and just having fun is the best attitude for this place.
