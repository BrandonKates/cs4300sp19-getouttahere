Maybe I just caught my meal at the wrong time? I went for an early dinner, so perhaps the veggies were a left over from the lunch rush??\nThe prices are high but fair for the food you get. \nThere are a few other Peruvian places around that I find to have better meals.

The charbroiled chicken never disappoints. Perfectly cooked and seasoned with that summer char-grilled taste. While they offer many types of sides, I appreciate the fried rice (the texture is never mushy or over done with salt or oils) and the grilled veggies (always cooked from fresh produce and cooked with some tooth left in them.) If you eat in, the platters portions are very generous. Enchiladas are around $12/plate but you get three meat filled tortillas that have the perfect balance of sauce and cheese with a side of fresh salsa, sour cream, beans and fried rice. You also have plenty of bright flavored, freshly made condiment sides to make these dishes stand out. Try the jalapeno cream sauce over the fried rice and veggies. Spicy, but not enough to keep you from finishing your meal. And the owners and staff are always making something new to try. The service is polite and you are always greeted with an authentic smile. If your are unsure of what to try, ask for a suggestion! (Additionally, the chicken, veggies and rice are dairy free. Our son has a dairy allergy and has no reactions).",

I ordered the cream of crab soup, the brisket and a quarter rack of ribs. For sides I got the Mac & cheese and the veggie of the day (green beans saut\u00e9ed in an Old Bay butter). \nThe soup was delicious and FULL of crab meat- the best I've had in this area. The brisket was delicious, if slightly on the fatty side. The flavor was great, even without BBQ sauce- just enough smokey flavor to be good, but not so much that it's overpowering (I've got a picky eater at home who hates smoke flavor, and he would have still enjoyed this). I ordered the smaller portion, and it came with about 4 good sized slices, and they were tender enough that I used a spoon to cut them. The ribs were cooked well- the meat came off the bone easily and had a nice crust, though they weren't quite as flavorful as the brisket. The Mac & cheese was good, definitely made in-house (unlike a lot of other restaurants), and the green beans were fresh, though a little bland. \nAll in all, it was a very good lunch and I'll definitely be back, especially for the crab soup and the brisket!",

I had an incredible curried vegetable stew, with subtle hints of coconut and cream. Tender chicken and attractive garnish. Soda refills were frequent from the extremely polite wait team.\n\nDespite it being their literal last supper in business, it was obvious the owners and employees put effort and care into their customers\u2019 experiences.

We went for brunch on Sunday and stood at the entrance for 10 minutes being ignored (wasn't very busy), when I finally asked if we seat ourselves or wait to be seated.  Server said someone would be with us and we ended waiting a while longer then finally the server came and just told us to sit by the fireplace.  We weren't aware it was only buffet and no menu.  The buffet was below par, frankly golden corral is better and a fraction of the cost.  Iceberg lettuce was not fresh, pork chops were so over cooked and dry almost like it was from a wedding the night before and just reheated. No one was at the egg making station or whatever it was, so I don't really know what was going on.  Prime rib was tough and cold and no horseradish.  Our server dropped off our drinks and that's all we saw of her.  Never got a refill on my coffee and drank all my water and had to resort to eating all of my ice bc apparently we were invisible and no one waited on us, at all.  The fireplace was nice and that's about it.  Over $18 for mediocre buffet and bad service not worth it. Go somewhere else!",

My mother and sister had steamed seafood platters and they were very dry, with no flavor. I had the shrimp and scallop scampi but it felt like they just melted butter and put parsley on top. The soda also tasted weird. It was flat and the soda didn't seem to have the right proportions of soda water and syrup. The reason this place was good was because of our server Kathleen. She was very sweet and beyond attentive. She made sure to fix any issues my family and I had. The only reason I gave this place 2 stars was because of how great Kathleen was.",

The other waitress were not as amazing, at all as they would not let my son and I walk past them even though they were not carrying food, just expected us to change course (let alone the fact he's a toddler, but especially not as easy when dealing with special needs) But our waiter completely made up for their rudeness!!! He was kind, and fun, and genuine. Oh and the food was really good! We ordered a ton of food and it was all cooked perfectly! So thank you to the chef, and thank you to our waiter for a great dinning experience!",

Reservations are a must because they book up and you will be unable to get a seat during peak hours.  My impression of the staff is that they are rather cordial, again a surprise.  So maybe not your typical louder, friendly, rowdy bar and grill type place, which I am not saying is good or bad, just different.  The food is good, but the unanimous consensus at my table is that the portion sizes could be bigger, especially for the price.   I can imagine those with heartier appetites leave feeling still a bit hungry.",

The food was very good and fairly priced...Service was very good.  The reason for 1 star?  I had the fried oysters which were excellent, however 7 hours later (2:30 A.M.), I was awakened to nausea, vomiting and well, I won't mention what else here.  I was very sick the entire next day which included a trip to Urgent Care where I was tested for the flu and ruled out.  Since the oysters, fries and coleslaw were the only meal I had eaten since pizza for lunch that day , I have to think the oysters were bad.  Obviously, the restaurant can't be held accountable for the seafood they receive, I suffered physically and financially for eating there.",
