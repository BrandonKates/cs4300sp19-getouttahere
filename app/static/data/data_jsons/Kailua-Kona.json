Erring on the side of caution, I decided to ask the front desk about my member status anyway. Sure enough, I knew they would screw it up. They stared at the screen in confusion and after a few minutes of squabbling amongst each other, claimed my card was now invalid! I protested that it was on a family plan and had indeed been renewed, but they claimed I could not prove that and the issue was with \"America\". They continued to blame \"America\" until I shouted them down saying it's not a problem with a country, it's a COSTCO problem. That shut them up and they issued a temporary pass. The next day they called me back to tell me my card was indeed activated. So all this was COMPLETELY unnecessary and blaming a country is just plain unprofessional. \nOh, and they won't let you buy one box of muffins. You are not even allowed to do so.

Beyond delicious pizza (the BBQ Chicken and the Jaws were awesome!), the folks behind the counter are kind, communicative, and hard working. \n\nOur first night, before we ordered, we were informed that the wait would be around 1.5 hours, due to a huge order being placed a while before us. That was obviously not what we had expected, and we considered looking elsewhere to eat. However, we opted for individual slices, which came out much quicker, and were just what we needed. An individual slice is definitely entree sized - these folks aren\u2019t playing. I appreciated their honesty and upfront message about the wait, but also that they were flexible enough to help feed us quicker! \n\nThe second time around, after having such yummy pie the first time, we ordered almost exactly what we did previously. So much so, that when our ticket read for a different item than what we ordered, the staff recognized our previous order and got it sorted out. Again, awesome! \n\nSo, if you are trying to find good pizza in Kona - this is it!", "time": 1533276038}, {"author_name": "Madeline Cannon", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108084686080002113730/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1TrDTMTP7TM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASA/MOkM-PcH2RA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "My husband and I visited Longboard Legends twice on our trip to the Big Island!
