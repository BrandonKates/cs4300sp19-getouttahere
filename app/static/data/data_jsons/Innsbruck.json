It\u2019s an eerie and immersive experience to be in them, perfectly reconstructed. Speaking of immersion, the museum does a great job in creating an atmosphere by grouping objects (and human-sized figures) to tell the story of the periods, and it\u2019s right next door to the Court Church (with the \u201cblack statues\u201d), including a passage that allows for a view from the choir of the church.

Lucifer is the \u2018light-bearer\u2019 who guides visitors through the \u2018new\u2019 Museum of Tyrolean Folk Art. He is the agent provocateur, the enfant terrible in our brave, seemingly well-ordered museum world. He asks questions, casts doubts, and undermines: what is art? What is craft? What is real? What only seems to be? Lucifer devotes himself to reality.\n\nThe varied exhibition areas include \u2018Miniaturen des Evangeliums\u2019 [\u2018Gospel Miniatures\u2019] (cribs), \u2018Pralles Jahr\u2019 [\u2018Year Full to Bursting\u2019], \u2018Prek\u00e4res Leben\u2019 [\u2018Perilous Life\u2019], \u2018Schein und Sein\u2019 [\u2018Illusion and Reality\u2019] (traditional costumes), the Studiensammlung [collection of studies], and the Stuben [parlours]. Visitors are also \u2018prepared\u2019 for the Court Church by an impressive preview.\n\nThe Museum of Tyrolean Folk Art in Innsbruck is one of the most beautiful of its kind in Europe. In 1888, the Tyrolean trade association decided to build a \u2018Tyrolean trade museum\u2019 in Innsbruck. Initially, exemplary crafted contemporary products were collected. They were meant to give Tyrolean craftsmen new ideas.\n\nLater, \u201cOld Tyrolean arts and crafts as well as the products of domestic Tyrolean diligence\u201d were also included in the collection. The collection of the \u2018Tyrolean museum for folk art and trade\u2019 (1903), which was then owned by the chamber of trade and commerce, was afterwards relocated to the former Franciscan monastery that still houses it today. In 1926, the Tyrolean chamber of trade and commerce handed the exhibits over to the County of Tyrol, obliging the county to \u201cset them up in a publicly accessible museum\u201d.\n\nIn 1929, the Museum of Tyrolean Folk Art\u2014as it was henceforth called\u2014was opened. Many of its objects had been purchased prior to World War I. They came from the old County of Tyrol, including the Province of Trento (southern part of the historic Trentino region), and the Ladin valleys around the Dolomites. The collection items belong to various social strata: the peasantry, the middle classes, and the nobility. The collection is centred on artisan craftwork, applied arts, domestic industry, popular piety, masks, and traditional costumes.", "time": 1543216698}]}, "status": "OK"}, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Maria-Theresien-Stra\u00dfe": {"type": "see", "description": ["innsbruck", "boulevard", "central", "pedestrian", "area", "st", "anna", "column", "prominent", "nordkette", "mountain", "range", "make", "popular", "backgrounds", "holiday", "photos"], "coordinates": [47.266137799999996, 11.3939903], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJUZstVeNrnUcR1T0Zsg2tpcY", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Herzog-Friedrich-Stra\u00dfe": {"type": "see", "description": ["old", "town", "main", "street", "pedestrian", "area", "expands", "square", "front", "golden", "roof"], "coordinates": [47.2684036, 11.3917421], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJrQk5rPtrnUcRZd4-eXnRt6Y", "reviews": {"html_attributions": [], "result": {}, "status": "OK"}, "purpose": ["educational"], "cost": ""}, "Sparkassenplatz": {"type": "see", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [47.2660504, 11.3951456], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJDcJQmPxrnUcRKL9HNJALrVA", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Alpengarten": {"type": "see", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [47.211018700000004, 11.4511918], "website": "http://www2.uibk.ac.at/bot-garden/alpen/eindex.html", "place_id": "ChIJr9Io8PJrnUcRtD5YR7C2fGs", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Botanischer Garten": {"type": "see", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [47.2678521, 11.3797808], "website": "http://bot-garden.uibk.ac.at/garten/eindex.html", "place_id": "ChIJC49cbXtaqEcR6I2NHP-sohU", "reviews": {"html_attributions": [], "result": {"rating": 4.5, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Malachi Griffith", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101018791363363548861/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-f5BMB5TKJwY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPw/VDLeK8JQhc4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "Among the best botanical gardens in the world.
