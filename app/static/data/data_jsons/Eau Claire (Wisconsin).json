L.. O.. W.. service. Food is okay, but it's quite cool/cold by the time you get it. Ordering at the bar idea is meh - noticed some bartenders ignore patrons approaching the bar. Three different types of their own beers that our group initially ordered were out. That's great if you're so popular that you run out of beer....but you ARE a brewery, so that kind of seems ironic. \nTipping is weird because you pay before you receive your food/service- I felt guilty doing less than a 20% tip because I didn't want to come off as a cheapskate, but then afterwards, I kind of wish I got about half of that back. I'm a former waitress, so I know how grueling it can be, but to drop off food and pick up plates (no check backs, drink refills, follow-ups in between) no, I'm sorry, it wasn't worth the 20%. $70 for 3 burger-type meals & 2 kids meals + 3 beers. Yikes! \n\nNot sure if they are slow because of low staff, few kitchen cooks/help, or because the staff has to wander around to search for the table they are looking for to deliver food. I REALLY was excited to come here and I REALLY wanted to like it, but it's just more of a hangout, drink beer, and stand around kind of place.
