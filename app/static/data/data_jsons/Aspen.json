Bells - Visit September 2018 during Fall.\n\nIt's been on my bucket list ever since I first saw a picture from this fantastic place.\nFinally here but only for one evening/morning, to enjoy The Bell's in all its beauty. \nI tried from my home in Denmark to read how and what to do, if you want to drive yourself. Not being overwhelmed or not being able to find  the information, I decided to make this attempt for a short walk-through. \n\nWhen the road is open (Closed during winter), you can drive your car to the park, but only if you get there before 8 am or after 5 pm. It's mandatory to buy a parking ticket, otherwise your car can get removed/towed. (The Car pass  cost $10, and is valid for 5 days)\nYou are NOT guaranteed a parking spot though. When the parking lot is full, it's all over. Arrive early. I would recommend around 6-7 o'clock.\n\nAttention: You either buy a car pass ticket at the Welcome Station when its open (I think open hours is 7am -7pm, and Welcome Station is located halfway between the roundabout in Aspen and the Bells), OR you pay at the Self Service Pay Station, right past the Welcome Station on the right side. If you arrive early in the morning (and it's pitch dark), I would recommend a flashlight, a pencil and 10$ (Cash or check) \nTake an envelope at the self service, fill in your information, and put the envelope and money in the green fee tube.\n\nThen drive to the parking lot, find a good spot and wait for the sun to rise.\nEnjoy ;)", "time": 1553175302}, {"author_name": "Google News24", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104481892709711611888/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1SP2s6xchIs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAgvU/_O1brWfDP28/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "It\u00a0is difficult to say when the timeless beauty of these two sentinels mirrored in the lake is more striking: In the summer, when every hiking trail takes you through fields of wild flowers, in the fall, when tall aspen trees dazzle with a rainbow of fall colors, or in the winter, when snow and ice silence the world.
