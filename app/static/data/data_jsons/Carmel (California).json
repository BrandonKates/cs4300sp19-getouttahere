The seafood pizza was loaded with scallops shrimp and roasted garlic on a thin crust. Very tasty. The bad - our salad took a while to come, and found parts of the slices of the steak particularly chewy. We did like the atmosphere and coziness of the restaurant.",

Pastries can be ordered quickly at the counter from an attendant dedicated to those sales, but sandwiches and coffee require a longer wait in a separate line.  Overall, fairly charming with great bread/sandwiches.",

The food was amazing, the atmosphere was very small town fireplace vibe, and with a live pianist and dim lit bar area this place was perfect for dinner with my girlfriend. Food was fairly priced and the steak was mouth watering. It is a little hard to see at night so try and help keep an eye out if you area getting a taxi at night. We would definitely recommend for a romantic dinner for 2 or a family dinner as well. Next time we are in Carmel we will definitely be going back to the Mission!",
