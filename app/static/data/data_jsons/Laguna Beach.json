Was told a complete pack of nonsense which didn't reflect our experience at all.  Advise me that we had been offered seating when we arrived, we weren't. Advised me we had to be spoken to in the first half of the show, we weren't.  Back-covering when staff are clearly in the wrong and need a lesson in manners as well as customer service.  I'm fairly accomodating and realise things can go wrong or people can have off nights, but the incident and the followup conversations were woefully inadequate and reinforce my feeling that The Stand is dead as a comedy option for my friends, family and myself.  The Rotunda is a much better prospect with good seating, quick table service, good acts, plenty space.  The Stand has done just that, stood still for 30 years.
