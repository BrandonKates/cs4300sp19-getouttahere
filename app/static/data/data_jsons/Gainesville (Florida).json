The food was awesome, I have had my culinary palate expanded and blown away - the food was flavorful and excellent. I had the tandoori hot chicken sandwich that was spicy and delicious. My daughter, who like all kids is an extremely picky eater had the chhole which she loved, and my wife's chicken tandoori was about the best chicken I have ever tasted. Service was excellent and all around a great experience, we will be back.", "time": 1463492353}]}, "status": "OK"}, "purpose": ["friends", "spring break", "romance"], "cost": ""}, "Best Western Gateway Grand": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://book.bestwestern.com/bestwestern/productInfo.do?propertyCode=10281", "place_id": "ChIJg2Ico7-76IgRx6BJk6EdBqI", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Comfort Inn West": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["offers", "guests", "free", "breakfast", "exercise", "room", "pool"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.comfortinn.com/hotel-gainesville-florida-FL102", "place_id": "ChIJeZT-IaPMyFIRkHmtBBQY-Ic", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": "low"}, "Courtyard Gainesville": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["located", "minutes", "university", "florida", "4", "miles", "swamp", "hotel", "offers", "pool", "hot", "tub", "free", "high", "speed", "internet", "rooms", "equipped", "fridge", "microwave"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/gnvcy-courtyard-gainesville/", "place_id": "ChIJOynEBiuj6IgR6LPhpwHZn_Y", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": "low"}, "Fairfield Inn Gainesville": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/GNVFI", "place_id": "ChIJQ9nudCij6IgRmGnaJ8nlbSQ", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Hilton Garden Inn Gainesville": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.hiltongardeninn.com/en/gi/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=GNVGFGI", "place_id": "ChIJuffUgCyj6IgRwS37y2QkO18", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Holiday Inn": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/hi/1/en/hd/gnvwe", "place_id": "ChIJGbfM_F9b34cRcJfbMuOuoFY", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Holiday Inn Express": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/ex/1/en/hd/gnvsw", "place_id": "ChIJn-2jXbyy-YgRXiD58ZEagHQ", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Homewood Suites Gainesville": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://homewoodsuites1.hilton.com/en_US/hw/hotel/GNVHWHW-Homewood-Suites-by-Hilton-Gainesville-Florida/index.do {{dead link|October 2016}}", "place_id": "ChIJ7eB-byuj6IgRn5iDp9ZeAZI", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Motel 6 Gainesville - Univ. of Florida": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.motel6.com/reservations/motel_detail.asp?MotelId=0414", "place_id": "ChIJxbzuDyqj6IgRtw4uHViK0V4", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Residence Inn Gainesville": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/GNVFL", "place_id": "ChIJK3_IW9O86IgRRiAbiy32C-k", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Paramount Plaza Hotel and Suites": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.paramountplaza.com", "place_id": "ChIJe0zfyKij6IgRr8uaVOF5bPw", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Sweetwater Branch Inn": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJKcZV3POj6IgRv7OgojldB68", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Hampton Inn: Gainesville": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJAYwXDdai6IgRI7BjTf0YmIE", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Red Roof Inn": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["offers", "outdoor", "pool", "open", "year", "round", "selected", "rooms", "offer", "microwave", "microfridge", "units", "rooms", "offer", "mobile", "high", "speed", "internet", "access", "included", "command", "video", "selection", "free", "tv", "channels", "pay", "view", "well", "one", "well", "behaved", "family", "pet"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.redroof.com", "place_id": "ChIJ5fgYhiw_xIkRD2OCykFesO8", "reviews": null, "purpose": ["family"], "cost": "low"}, "Residence Inn Gainesville I-75": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["suites", "hotel", "located", "3", "miles", "university", "florida", "suites", "provide", "full", "kitchens", "complimentary", "internet", "flat", "screen", "tv", "hotel", "amenities", "include", "complimentary", "hot", "breakfast", "complementary", "parking", "pool", "fitness", "center"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/gnvgi-residence-inn-gainesville-i-75/", "place_id": "ChIJK3_IW9O86IgRRiAbiy32C-k", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}}, "coordinates": ["29.686471", "-82.276741"]}}
