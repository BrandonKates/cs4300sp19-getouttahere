From the bearded gentleman working meat without a hairnet to the guy with gold glasses working hot food that hates his job, I see daily examples that employees are no longer the cheery, environmentally conscious type and are now just any retail employees that would take any job. They're not all bad - - the vets in seafood are awesome - - but it's noticeable every time I visit. \n\n2. The PRICING games are tiring. \"we're slashing prices!\" *weeks later * \"just kidding, here's 10% off for sale items, but all prices have been silently raised by 20%!\" it seems like my bill has steadily crept up for the past year as some nerd with an algorithm tests price elasticity.\n\n3. They've increased the amount of self serve hot bar items while decreasing the amount of employees serving the reasonably priced hot vegetables. I frequently find myself trying to track down an employee, waiting for new batches of veggies, or waiting in a long line. To boot, the hot food quality is lower across the board.

BEST BURGER PLACE EVER!!! I've been coming here since 1997 and it never disappoints. The burgers are amazing. A few things to remember if your ordering food(remember....no soup for you!) Look at the menu and know what you want PRIOR to getting to the window. Have cash to cover plus a cash tip. Make sure the cook sees you put the tip in the jar. Wait your 45-90 minutes and enjoy!!!", "time": 1551751542}, {"author_name": "Ron Rubio", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117825465099012881790/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Yg8FLvH3RZ0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAJ6w/9xL-fDQ_mVo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 weeks ago", "text": "This place has some really great burgers.

When we asked why it took so long and complained about the cold food (again to another staff as our waitress was nowhere to be seen) we were told that it was such a long wait time because my dietary issues caused the food to take longer. This would be understandable if our waitress had come to update us, if the food had not been supper cold and if I had ordered something that needed a substitute. I got toast eggs and bacon with roasted potatoes. The toast was the only item that needed special precautions. \nDuring the 2 hours we were there we only saw our waitress twice.
