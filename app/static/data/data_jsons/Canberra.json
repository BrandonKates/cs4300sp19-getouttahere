                "text": "The Drill Hall was built in 1940 to train soldiers for the Second World War. The 3rd Battalion, Werriwa Regiment was based in this building in 1941-2.\n\nIn 1984 the interior was superbly remodelled to create an art gallery which is considered one of the most beautiful of its kind. In 2004 a Heritage order was placed on the building.\n\nWhile the National Gallery of Australia waited for the completion of its building, temporary exhibitions of the national collection were held here. In 1992 the Australian National University took over the Drill Hall Gallery as a showcase for its own art collection and as a venue for temporary exhibitions.There are 4 discrete exhibition spaces.\n\nThe Gallery is a venue of choice for many of Australia\u2019s leading contemporary artists, curators and collectors. We have developed a proud tradition of impeccably presented landmark exhibitions accompanied by scholarly publications.\n\nSidney Nolan\u2019s 9-panel panorama, Riverbend (recently nominated among the ten must-see art treasures of Canberra) is on permanent display in the RIVERBEND ROOM.\n\nThe Drill Hall Gallery provides the Canberra community and ANU with a selective program of high quality exhibitions of Australian and international art.\n\nThe Gallery supports the arts in the Canberra region by presenting exhibitions developed in conjunction with the University\u2019s wide-ranging academic interests and or to coincide with major conferences and public events. National and international exhibitions \u2013 and works from the University\u2019s own extensive collection \u2013 are features of the Gallery\u2019s program.",

Family historians find a wealth of information in our records, as do academics and other researchers.",

The second time I was in Canberra was for the Australian Running Festival and I decided to come to the AIS for some swimming training. This place is a hidden gem for lap swimming. I have been a swimmer for a significant portion of my life. I\u2019ve been to multiple different pools and battled chaotic pools with zero lane availability. This place is the opposite and it is a dream. I swam on the weekend and weekday nights and there was hardly anyone there. There were two full sized pools open to the public. I really appreciate the way the AIS makes the facility available to the public, I can\u2019t wait to return.  This is the highlight of any trip to Canberra.",

                "text": "This home was built for the Calthorpe family in 1927, the year the Federal Parliament and public service were transferred to Canberra. Harry and Dell Calthorpe moved to Canberra from Queanbeyan, having seen the potential of the new city first hand through Harry\u2019s role in land auctions in the growing Federal Capital.\n\nThe Calthorpes chose the architects Oakley and Parkes to design their home; the same firm that had won a national competition to design suitable houses for the Federal Capital, and had also designed the Prime Minister\u2019s residence, the Lodge.\n\nThe house was designed for the hot, dry Canberra summers and to correspond with the Garden City ideal of a free-standing cottage set within a large garden. Like many Canberra houses of this period it has a roughcast exterior finish painted in earthy colours, a tiled roof with shingled gables, arched verandahs and shuttered windows.\n\nAdding to a few treasured items of furniture transferred from their old house, Mrs Calthorpe selected new furniture and household items from Beard Watson & Co. in Sydney. As most of the furnishings and fittings were purchased at the same time, and were carefully cared for by Mrs Calthorpe rather than being replaced, the house and its contents remain excellent examples of the prevailing style of the time.\n\nThe Calthorpe Family\nHarry Calthorpe was a partner in the stock, station and real estate agency of Woodgers and Calthorpe. The firm conducted the first sale of leases in Canberra in 1924. Harry had served in WW1, sustaining injuries at Gallipoli which saw him return to Australia to work in the recruiting campaign. Harry married Della Ludvigsen in 1917 and their two daughters, Del and Dawn, were born in Queanbeyan.\n\nThe girls grew up alongside the new city of Canberra, attending the Church of England Girls\u2019 Grammar School which was a short walk from their home. Del married Captain STG Coleman in 1942, and in 1944 Dawn married Douglas Waterhouse, an entomologist at the CSIRO where Dawn worked as a laboratory assistant.\n\nHarry Calthorpe died in 1950, and his wife Dell remained living in the house until shortly before her death in 1979. In the mid 1980s, as many in our community were becoming concerned about the loss of Canberra\u2019s heritage, the Federal Government purchased Calthorpes\u2019 House. It is now preserved as a window into a family\u2019s life in our city\u2019s early years.\n\nA guide to the rooms\nCalthorpes\u2019 House is divided into areas based on function, with the public rooms grouped at the front of the house, the family\u2019s private rooms are separated by the hall and passage and the domestic work areas are toward the rear of the house.\n\nInterior decoration\nThe stained blackwood panelling in the hall is mirrored in the ceiling beams of the dining room and the ceiling of the sitting room. Other timber used in the house has been stained to match, while the walls are rough-rendered and painted.   The public rooms are encircled by a plate rail for the display of ornaments.\n\nThe rooms were very comfortable and fashionable and have altered little since the Calthorpes\u2019 time. The gramophone, pianola, records and bridge cards reflect the family\u2019s entertainment and pastimes. Mrs Calthorpe was a keen bridge player, and many of the items on display were won in bridge competitions.\n\nKitchen, pantry and bathroom\nThere was a new focus on the science of hygiene in the 1920s which is reflected in the use of easily cleaned surfaces such as tiles and linoleum. The Calthorpes welcomed the new domestic technology of a toaster, iron and fan, but they still relied on an ice chest which required daily supplies of block ice. The stove burned solid fuel, but was later replaced by an electric Early Kooka stove.\n\nIn the 1920s tradesmen delivered most household supplies to the back door. A tradesman\u2019s safe is located on the back porch in which goods would be placed if the house\u2019s occupants were not at home. On the wall in the pantry is a grocer\u2019s reminder list made of tin.\n\n.",

                "text": "Construction of the complex began in June 1963 with operations commencing in December 1964, in time to support the Mariner 4 spacecraft encounter with Mars. The centrepiece of the complex was the 26-metre antenna (Deep Space Station 42). Two years later a crewed spaceflight wing was added to the complex to assist with the Apollo missions to the Moon. By 1970 the complex featured a power station, and facilities to manage the sewage and water supplies, while a cafeteria, and sleeping accommodation fed and housed the many workers on site. During early 1969 construction started on a new antenna. At 73 metres in height and weighing more than seven million kilograms, the then 64-metre antenna (Deep Space Station 43) took nearly four years to complete. The need for such an antenna was brought about by the increasing amounts of data received and the rapidly expanding distances that spacecraft were travelling. The new 64-metre antenna was more than six times as sensitive as the existing 26-metre antenna, and therefore could extend the useful lifetime of a spacecraft as its signal became weaker the further it was from Earth.\n\nDuring the 1980s the Voyager spacecraft travelled billions of kilometres to investigate the \u2018gas giants\u2019 Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Over such distances, the signals from the spacecraft would be extremely weak and requiring more sophisticated equipment on Earth to receive them.\n\nConsequently, in 1980 the 26-metre antenna was upgraded to become a 34-metre antenna, improving the surface of the dish and adding higher frequency receiving capabilities. Similarly in 1987, the 64-metre antenna was upgraded to 70 metres in diameter. Even today, the 70-metre antenna is the largest steerable parabolic antenna in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nWhen Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station closed in December 1981, the 26-metre antenna was relocated to Tidbinbilla and renamed Deep Space Station 46 where it was used for spacecraft positioned close to the Earth. It was retired in 2009.\n\nIn 1986 the construction of a new high efficiency 34-metre antenna (Deep Space Station 45) was completed to provide better reception at higher frequencies. The antenna was completed in time for the Voyager 2 encounter with Uranus, where it was used in conjunction with the 70-metre antenna to provide even greater sensitivity for the reception of signals. Deep Space Station 45 was decommissioned in 2016.",

There are sculptures as well as paintings and sketches. Although I found much of it interesting, there are probably too many displays to make seeing the whole gallery a totally enjoyable experience. On the other hand, there is so much information about each of the items that it would be difficult to rush through too quickly.  It's great that our explorers, Australia's original people and business, sport and political figures are acknowledged with a portrait in the gallery. There is paid car parking below and a cafe.",

First of all they do not have any single piece of fruit on the menu, how comes the best breakfast does not include any kind of fruits? Second, the green tea was a very small pot and not good at all. I ordered brown toast with jam and they charged me the jam separately, unbelievable!! first place where they charged me the jam separately... and the toast was not cheap at all, crazy ehh?? Finally, when I went to pay, they do not accept credit card transactions under 20 AUD and they do not split bills.... and I must say the attention was not good at all!! Conclusion, I still can not understand how this place is considered the best breakfast place in Canberra in 2013... I've been here since last two weeks and even the smallest and shinny coffee shop is better than Tosolini's",

First time to hear such a greeting at a restaurant) A table for two please.\n- Let me check with the kitchen if still open\n- (Seriously again!! Like, WTH, are you doing here if the kitchen is closed, they would've informed you early on, and it's still 13:30)\n\nSo we waited for his confirmation then got seated. He literally threw the napkins at our laps. \n\nFood was fine, anything but authentic. Small portion,  e.g., a small portion of rice to share\n\nPaid more than what the experience was worth.",
