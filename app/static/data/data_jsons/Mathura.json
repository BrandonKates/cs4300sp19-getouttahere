Tourist attraction of devotees. Devotees from other countries visits most of the time. it was a incredible experience there that there is no permission to stay inside of the prison of lord Krishna but the female foreigner(devotee) were feeding her child milk. that emotion of mother and child was great. Must visit this place in a life. Another one important thing is that security has high level. You cannot take a single pin inside. Mobile phones, Cameras and other equipment cannot take inside.
