Make sure that you check the timetable so that you catch the reenactments and demonstrations. Musket firing, gold panning, sweet making, pantomime, mine tours, coach rides... The list goes on and on. Bring a picnic or buy food here. You really need a couple of days to see it all. Make sure that you wear comfortable shoes. Enjoy going back to the Gold rush in the 1800s.",

Great place to take the kids for a special treat and awesome place for birthday parties but does get very busy so bookings are essential. Very accommodating to babies and they have newspapers and a giant chess table if you get a little bored.",
