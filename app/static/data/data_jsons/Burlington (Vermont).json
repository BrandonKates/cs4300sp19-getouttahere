I'm disappointed with nearly every other surviving pizza place around here, so Big Daddy's could possibly be the best in all of Vermont.  It's the closest equivalent to something you might find in northern New Jersey or Manhattan.  It's not conveyor belt pizza like Domino's or the one that wins the Seven Daisies award every year. It's not as thin or greasy as Port Authority pizza, so it's just right.  I wish they still had their Colchester location or that it was easier to find parking and run in for takeout at their downtown spot, though.  The 5 star rating is for the food.", "time": 1548446321}, {"author_name": "Martha Jensen", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107486963834836800996/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-R1cdhPA1_D4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/KEPG-0Ri_jo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "I loved the pizza here.
