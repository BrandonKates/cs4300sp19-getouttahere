                "text": "Visited and thoroughly enjoyed 4.7km walk around lake. Largely a shaded track, it would be difficult for the mobility impaired. The lake is white scenic and an excellent opportunity to leave the crowds on the surf coast for a closer encounter with nature! There are bench seats to rest on and admire the view. We did the lap in just over an hour and then then wonderful lunch in nearby Forrest. You could easily take a picnic and spend longer. The circuit can be done clockwise, starting just short of the canoe launching platform on the left, or keep to the right of the lake viewing platforms and travel anti clockwise. (The signage is lacking at this point.)\nA picnic ground is close to the car park. Toilets are also available.There is also a separate camping ground, though only suitable for tents as cars a parked a little distance away. It is not suitable for caravans or camping trailers.",

I humbly request that you add an outdoor archery range, as the closest one is about 50 minutes drive away. There is a considerable and growing population of archers in this area. Even a really small archery range would be good. A fee is fine, but I think that such a place would really draw new crowds of youth and elderly alike to have some fun in the sun. \nPlease like this comment so that the city will see it\nThank you",

The museum is modest but very interesting and continues to grow funded by donors. And every Saturday night and Sunday afternoon (mostly) silent films are shown in the old theater that has been fixed up to look as it did when Charlie Chaplin and Bronco Billy Anderson made films in the Niles area. One of the most interesting parts of the theater is its original projection room that had been sealed up for decades when the theater was sold with its original projection equipment in place.",

I believe our tour guide had mentioned the Museum had opened in 2012.\nI had been living away from my hometown for several years.\nWas really nice to discover this Museum, the tour guide was knowledgable, and friendly.\nI learned a few things that I didn't already know, saw the theater that featured silent movies, saw the projection room full of old reels, and antique equipment.\nMy friend was very impressed to learn that nearby Niles Canyon was frequently used as a backdrop for some of the movies for Bronco Billy and Charlie Chaplin.\nThere were framed photographs on the walls of the bungalows that housed the casts and crews in the alleys behind the buildings on the main street, also a souvenir shop.\nWe very much enjoyed the display of antique clothing worn for that period.\nNo fee to enter or tour, however, a donation jar is on the counter if you wish to support their efforts.\nLarge parking lot across the street for free parking.\nEnjoy!",

The piano accompianist is remarkable, playing background music for the movie with no sheet music and playing non stop for the length of the show. Amazing!! Now that's Talent. The evening we attended the movies, there were quite a few school aged children in the audience. I thought they would be bored because they were used to all the modern movie technology, but to my surprise, they we're loving it all. Some school classes go there as a field trip and make their own videos at the location spots they had seen in the movies. There is a walking tour of all the historic locations. A definite Must Visit!",

                "text": "Very fast service for an AYCE restaurant as well as short wait to get seated. Overall headed to this place since Little Dipper Shabu was super packed (my go to). Overall the mushroom soup base is pretty good, aside from that, the soup bases were lackluster and didn't have much flavor depth to them. Not bad selection of meat. I see they're unique with trying 4 bases... But quality>quantity at the end of the day. The sauce bar was badly organized and just in an awkward place. Also wished their Chinese donuts were crispy and not cold and soft.",

It's thinly sliced beef with broccoli and wide noodles in a scrumptious sauce. You have the option of ordering it spicy or mild. The Thai iced tea is delicious! The restaurant is always full but the wait is not very long. The staff is friendly and helpful if you have questions. They do a tremendous business, it's always busy. Best time to go is around 5:00 if you enjoy an earlier dinner. If you have to wait, it's well worth it!",

They were quick to take the ordered and didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes for food to be brought to the table. The appetizer and the main course brought together.\n\nWe had the Angel Chicken Wings for starters. This was pretty good. The best amongst everything else I had.\n\nWe then had the Basil Fried Rice with chicken and Shrimp and my friend had the Fried Rice with Fried Chicken. Both these dishes were okay. I love Thai food and have had the same dish in many places. So comparatively it was just okay. I felt there was too much oil used which was masking all the other flavors.\n\nWe wanted to order one of the Curry's on the menu. But they said we have to order rice separately for that. That was a bit weird.\n\nSo:\nService: 5\nFood: 3.5\nPrice: 3.5\nValue for money: 3\n\nThere are many more items on the menu to choose from. So the 3.5 average rating I have given doesn't mean I am disappointed but it just  goes for the dishes I tried today.",

These are the dishes I've had here:\n- green onion and pork dry noodle: It was really oily, but the flavor was really good and unique. There was a lot of meat, and I wish they put vegetables or something because I sort of got tired of eating it after a while. It could also do with more onion!\n- pork noodle soup: The fried pork pieces were too thin and too dry, so the pork wasn't too good. The noodles were good too. The soup had a bone base, so the soup itself has flavor. The noodle soup and noodles were really good, pork not so much.\n- watercress wonton soup: I really like the dumpling skin. It's quite chewy and sturdy, unlike a lot of skins which are really soft and somewhat mushy. The insides are good too; vegetable dumplings are so good. The soup it got served in is good too; again, the soup has a bone base, so the soup has flavor. They also put egg strips and seaweed too. Yum! The only complaint I have is the soup was more oily than it could have been.\n- spicy beef noodle soup: beef is really tender, and there are green vegetables (yay)! There are a lot of noodles, and it's sufficiently spicy. Quite good.\n- Shanghai soup dumplings (xiao long bao): they're decent! There's soup inside, and the skin is pretty chewy and good. There's a lot of meat inside, and it's pretty tender. I was pretty impressed with these.\n- vegetable with rice cake: it was too salty and oily, but the flavor was pretty good. The portions were small compared to the other portions they serve, but still decent.\n\nAll the dishes had really huge portions! And for so cheap. They also give free tea eggs, one for each dish you order I think. Quite good. I would definitely come here again if I want to eat noodles.",

Not long ago they hired a new waitress she is so mean and rude and unhappy person. Whenever the time for it to be closed and customer still eating at their table she is making loud noise, start banding the table, vacuum, pushing customer to get out. I don't think she is a right person for the job. I think that is one of the reason they're been losen customer a lot not because their food.",
