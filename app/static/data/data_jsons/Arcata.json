Instead, as far as burgers go, you get a delicious meal that is freshly prepared and presented in a clean casual environment.\n\nI like that they have a counter, so that's a great option if you're flying solo. There are several varieties of burger to choose from, so you can take a pick of what you're into. I went during a special burger week and really liked the Buffalo Burger. They also do shakes, and my Cookies N' Cream was amazing.\n\nOverall, a solid stop for a burger. It's a popular spot during the school year, so you might find it a bit crowded at times. I don't like how they ask you if you want to add a tip at the point of sale, but I understand their reasoning.", "time": 1538006925}, {"author_name": "Arynn Baldwin", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102723875587852192537/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QiqnLQBUXO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdB7Ox47vZ9yaEHPJ1v5H3oW5vX1w/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "Best food and service around arcata", "time": 1554499337}]}, "status": "OK"}}, "The Alibi": {"type": "drink", "description": ["good", "place", "get", "local", "manhattan", "orange", "twist"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJETomCw9X0VQRHRcGFOv3coU", "reviews": null}, "Ritas": {"type": "eat", "description": ["serves", "best", "mexican", "food", "town"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJB4usgQVX0VQRud7qXlDy0AY", "reviews": {"html_attributions": [], "result": {"price_level": 1, "rating": 4.1, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Heidi Monteverde", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111266480795279858322/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XLP8YZrIAEw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAANjw/wEXoGX-AuFw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "I went there for Taco Tuesday.
