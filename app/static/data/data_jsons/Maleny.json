The meat fell apart, which I thought was a good sign but it was completely grey and tasteless, as was the liquid it was sitting in. The dish was accompanied by a bowl of rice; 3 slices each of tomato and cucumber; a green herb sauce; a small piece of frozen corn cob that was still cold and a bowl of black beans that were the tastiest and most Brazilian thing on the plate.\nOur waiter was extremely friendly but, he forgot our order for a 2nd glass of wine with our main, which he was very apologetic of but then also neglected our request for a replacement bottle of table water.\nThe meals were served in an array of tiny dishes which serves to disguise the small portions and clutter the table. We left disappointed and still hungry for our $125 dinner. \nSuch a shame because Leesa is so lovely and it's such a beautiful space and concept.
