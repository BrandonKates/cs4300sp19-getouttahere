Very poignant brave women, men and children keeping important memories, struggles and history to life during these chaotic times. Through dance, music, singing, and poetry it was a lively mix of love, life, loss, and the importance of humanity. \n\nMy small children were quiet and in awe of the performances. I truly felt touched in my soul and shed a few tears of overwhelming care, thought and compassion. I will be attending every year moving forward. I would love to be involved more!

Ordered the Mama Rudy and it was bland, cardboard-ish crust and cheese was barely melted, not close to bubbly and the toppings were a bit raw (not in a good way.) 2.) The women's restroom was disgusting. The toilet looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. Like we're talking stuff growing in the bowl (isn't there a state health regulation on restroom cleanliness...especially in an eating establishment?) The floor was equally dirty. Then the toilet paper dispenser was positioned in a way that made it very difficult to retrieve, which was an issue after trying to create a major toilet paper barrier on the toilet seat to deem it useable. If I wasn't in dire need to utilize it, I would have gladly walked several blocks to use a decent restroom. 3.) I decided to give their large chocolate chip cookie a try in hopes of redeeming the previous two issues. It was OK, just plain dough and chocolate chips...very plain. The real issue, however, was that there was a piece of eggshell in the cookie. Luckily I noticed the little white thing in the otherwise smooth featureless top of the cookie. I was able to dig it out before my tooth crunched it...whew, I would have gagged. Luckily I was in good company during my visit, making my time there otherwise enjoyable. I wasn't feeling up to confronting the staff about any of these issues as I should have. It was my husband's birthday so I didn't want any potential unpleasantness so I kept it all to myself. I understand that this establishment's price point is low for Bellingham, but I would still expect edible food and a bathroom cleaned at least once a week.
