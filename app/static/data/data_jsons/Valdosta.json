Over there the pizza was amazing. Simply to die for. And when we moved here I was so excited to see that there was a location near us. We drove from Lafayette to dine here because we loved the locations in Georgia so much. I was so disappointed. More like heartbroken. Our buffalo pizza stopped being made halfway up the pizza leaving a thick piece of crust. Our bbq chicken side was burnt. We asked for no onions on both sides there were onions. The crust was not like the other locations. It was hard. My son got the pretzel bites the only good thing that came to our table. It's what I expected my crust on my pizza to be. Our waitress forgot about us once it got busy. The host was the only reason this place got 2 stars. She was amazing and so friendly with my son. I think it needs to meet the management at other locations. Next time we will wait till I visit my in laws in Georgia. Such a huge let down. And dont tell me about it being burnt because it goes into an oven when 2 completely different locations have the same crust and same quality of food on the opposite sides of Georgia.
