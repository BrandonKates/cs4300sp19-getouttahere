Even the very building is a work of art, walk slowly by the reflecting pool and search for the hidden rock garden. I've been in love with the Kimbell for 30 years, since as a child I first looked, wide-eyed at the works of Monet, a special exhibit they were holding. Thus began my love for art. I encourage you to visit the free exhibit at very least, and find out when an exhibition that interests you is coming and go to that. But just go.",

The parking can be a little awkward as you'll most likely have to parallel park off the side of a two-way, two-lane street. Overall a fun place to visit every so often - better for adults, teens, and older kids as I don't believe they have a ton of options for keeping young children entertained.",

We did the petting zoo which was nice, but the animals are behind a short fence. You can pet and feed them, but can't hold them or walk around with them.",

I had the veal with rissoto cake, which was wonderfully savory. Even my date who hates rissoto had to admit that this was excellent. My date ended up with the tenderloin, which he said was some of the best he's ever had.\n\nJust keep in mind, the restaurant is very small and fills up fast inside, though they also have outdoor seating. The chairs inside are not the comfiest, but the food definitely outweighed that in my estimation. \n\nI haven't had Italian food this tasty at a restaurant since I was last in Italy. It's a quirky little place with great food, so I highly recommend it.",

I wanna wanted to call in an order and had to wait 7 minuets before I hung up and come in to place it. I stood at the front do another 10 minuets and no on came!!! So I sat in the car and started this review, convincingly enough 7 woman pull up of different characteristics (and I NEVER use race as an issue but being someone who works in restaurants I observed) and followed back in behind them. They get seated IMMEDIATELY and I\u2019m back at front for another couple of minutes before Juan was nice enough to greet me and take my order.... my advice.... don\u2019t have your window where people walking in can see all of your staff laughing at the window! I\u2019ve worked in restaurants for at least 5 years and can only tolerate so much. Juan definitely deserves a raise if he\u2019s not a manager because I see him taking on all the responsibilities of EVERY position.",

Plus, despite showing up before 3 on a Sunday, the lunch portions offered in the menu aren\u2019t available. Lastly I appreciate all the local beers on the drink menu, but you no longer had three of them and fail to post the prices of the ones you did have. I\u2019m not going to freak, but I should have been forewarned of an 11 dollar bottle of local beer....Especially since we had two! lol. That being said, it was a nice visit.

Nothing. Then they acted like we ordered it that way. Come on, that's nuts. I ordered a side salad that came with expired dressing. The bread was ROCK hard. We couldn't physically chew it. We had to spit it out. Ridiculous. My meal had zero flavor, was over cooked, and the waitress didn't care the food was terrible. She barely checked on us and we had to stop three other waitresses just to fill up our drinks. The only good thing were the fries.",

As I explained that I only have one child and have no reason to order two. He rudely snatched the ticket out of my hand and walked off. He then sent someone else to bring my ticket back. His customer service is soo disgusting and I cannot express how upsetting it is to see someone with a leadership position not only act this way towards their customers but also be this example to the fellow employees. I was a loyal customer prior to the change of management and change of food quality. This was a place I recommended to all my friends and family. I will NOT EVER go back to this restaurant.

The biggest complaint I have is that they charged my credit card wrong. I have a photo image of the receipt that clearly shows the total as well as an incorrect total balance charged to my card (not pending - charged). I will be disputing this charge and never returning. How unethical can you be to blatantly mis-charge a card? WORST PLACE EVER.",

When we first walked in it took them a bit to acknowledge us and figure out which table they wanted us to sit at. The queso is not worth the price but the dinners were decent. The tamales are good but the chimis are more than half full with rice. A kids soda is $2.50 which is kinda high IMO. Their twist on a white Russian is pretty tasty tho, has a little bit of a bite. The decor is pretty cool. All in all it wasn't a terrible experience but I don't think we will be back.",

We will return. Note that, as a chef, I read all reviews of a new (to me) establishment, Always the low rating, where I can usually discern valid complaints from ignorant complaints. Anyone can write a positive review of a restaurant, but what are its short-comings. Reata has wonderful atmosphere, superb service and delicious and somewhat edgy offerings on the menu. Highly recommended for a higher-end dining experience.",
