The waiter asked, right off the bat, if we wanted separate checks - which was nice because we did.  The cafe wasn't too busy, it was a little after 7 PM, so there was no waiting.\nI had the 5-way Chili Mac with Veggie Chili and a Diet Coke.  They started us out with corn bread after serving us our drinks and our food was served pretty quickly and was tasty.  Afterwards, even though I shouldn't have, I ordered a Reese's Peanut Butter Pie.  To be honest I was full but the dessert menu looked so good!  And the pie was perfect - with whipped cream and some chocolate syrup. \nOverall the price wasn't that bad either, even including the tip.  I have to say the Hard Times Cafe is one of those places where you CAN visit it a few times a season without worrying about your wallet and just enjoy the food.  Also, it is far enough away from the Waterfront NOT to be too crowded or filled with tourists.  But it also means it is close to the King Street Station when you need to get back home via one of the buses or the subway.
