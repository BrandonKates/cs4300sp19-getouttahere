Its $16 for an adult and $7 for child over 5 and under 13.\n\nThe war ship is in its original condition with many old mattresses, ropes still intact and kept inside. \n\nAs the ship is not restored or preserved, it looks like its parked in the junk yard rather than in the museum. It should be maintained or atleast be painted to take off the rust and make it more appealing to the crowd. \n\nAll being said, I still liked the overall experience as we could see many small chambers in their original shape. I have never seen the anchor room before and was amazed to see the width and length of the rope.\n\nThe museum at back had lots of items to explore.\n\nPS: the ship is all metal and being on sunny side of Brisbane river it gets heated up fast. There are couple of pedestal fans but they can only do as much.",

Kids are catered for with lots of dinosaur stuff as well as plenty of interactive activities, which change regularly. There are some real Aussie items here that are very exciting such as material from Bligh's ship. Buses are across the road and the ferry is just a step away. I would suggest that visitors park somewhere else in Brisbane and catch the bus or ferry to South Bank.",

                "text": "Disappointing experience!\n\nThe location is perfect, with view on the Brisbane river and the Storey Bridge. The interior is cosy and well designed.\n\nThe service staff were rather cold, they did their job and brought us plates, filled in the water and wine. However, it felt like we were an inconvenience and to be honest it is the first time this happened in a restaurant of this standard.\n\nThe food was interesting, however some flavours were clashing in the mouth and one flavour would overpower the other one resulting in not tasting the weaker flavour any more. An example is with the Snapper, the fish had a very delicate taste that could have been brought to life with some well-chosen ingredients. However, in this instance there was the pickled daikon and given its strong flavour, blanketed the flavour of the fish completely.\n\nThe last comment would be in regard to the 1985 port - which came with 1/5 of sediments in my class and all around it. I didn't notice the sediments in my glass until it became evident that a dark and murky substance was lying at the bottom.\n\nIt was for a special occasion that we went to Aria and for a restaurant of this standard, I was expecting better service and better food.",

This time however the staff would hardly look you in the eye when you were talking to them. We were sat at a table where the roof was dripping water and we had to start moving ourselves before they even tried to assist. They then didn\u2019t put any sign for safety or cloth down where it had been dripping. The food was good however we were not given the correct amount. One dish we got didn\u2019t have as many pieces as we had ordered and the other dish they gave us twice as many as we first ordered. When advising staff of issues they would apologise with no look of actual empathy and instead would avoid us and talk to each other about the issues instead of providing us with an actual apology regarding the lack of service. My father can go to Sake at least two times a week and often brings clients and he has advised this is the second time in 3 weeks the service has been horrible and he will be dropping back his business with the restaurant.",

They keep relationships with many language schools (I guess they keep relationships in almost all language schools in Brissie), moreover have lots of specials. I really got a lot of benefits thanks to that specials. Furthermore, all staffs in Sol edu are kind and have lots of experiences.

I purchased a voucher from Living Social for their 5 course Discovery Menu. Upon arrival, we were referred to as the 'Living Social Table' and were seated at a table right against the front door and a wall. The table and chairs were on a slope. The table was wobbling and I had to constant adjusting my chair to stop it from sliding. \n\nAfter expressing my dissatisfaction to the Manager we were moved to a different table. However, it has ruined the fine dining experience. \n\nIn all fairness, I would give the food 4 stars.

Easily the best atmosphere of any cafe I\u2019ve ever been to. Seating options for 1-10 people both inside and out. Clearly it is a cultural centre for West End where many people meet for clubs and associations but this doesn\u2019t ruin the atmosphere. Can\u2019t recommend it highly enough. (Also great date location with lots to see in West End and Southbank before finishing the date at the Three Monkeys with a drink and some Turkish delight)",

Excellent smooth whiskey mellow and seeing Josh and Alex who have perfected the Best Espresso Martinis in Brisbane. If you have not visited this quaint cocktail lounge take it from an old school chef  this is truly a blessing to find in the South Brisbane and West End district. I urge you to make an effort to acquaint yourself with this delightful place, the ambience is sublimely perfect the choice to kick off a night with a paramour or to end an evening with close friends. Whatever fits your mood but I urge you to please visit this place. I can guarantee you will not be dissapointed.",

Given there ware maybe 5 other tables seated at the time I don't really see how that's reasonable. Furthermore, our mains ware just plain awful, the lamb shanks ware bland, had no sauce, the mash had an excessive amount of truffle oil and the asparagus had no seasoning; The pork belly was cooked to a crisp to the point where i couldn't distinguish between the meat and the crackling and the center was just pure rendered fat, and the \"candied walnuts\" ware really just plain walnuts and they ware so stale they seemed to have been left in an open container for a week over the kitchen bench before being used.\n\nIf you're in the area just head next door to Zero Fox, you'll be much better off.",
