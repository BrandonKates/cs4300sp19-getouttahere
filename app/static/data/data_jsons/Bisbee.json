Make sure you get there early to reserve a spot as it seems like the tickets (on weekends anyways) sell out one or two tours early.  The tour guide was very informative, and pretty funny in a 'dad joke' kind of way.    I'm not sure I'd take the tour more than once unless they opened up a new part of the mine, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't done it before.",

If you want quality and a variety even with Safeway brands  Safeway is great for that. They have a deli, bakery and pharmacy. They also have a Starbucks inside. The one complaint I have lately with them is their meat department. The quality of their meat isn't as great as it use to be. We've found bone grit on the pork and bones in boneless skinless chicken. Otherwise I love their produce, breads, desserts and products!! Plus you'll always get GREAT customer service and asked if you need help out!! Or you can also do self checkout instead.",
