Have always loved the food. Last time we ordered, there was a hair in one of our soups. Two of us ordered the same soup. Needless to say it really made our stomachs churn and ruined lunch for all five of us that had ordered. I called to speak to a manager. The woman that answered the phone was beyond rude. She had no idea what I was calling for and said \"they too busy to speak to you\". Mind you, I could have been calling for catering info because I had not given my reason for calling yet. When I insisted on needing to speak to a manager, the delivery manager got on the phone. I explained everything. She apologized and said \"Your next delivery order will be comped. I'm putting it in the book.\" (I didn't ask her to do this.) So we called today to order and spoke to the delivery manager who said she could only comp the cup of soup. Since that is not what she told me, I asked to speak to the GM who proceeded to say that they can only comp the soup. I asked if they record their calls -- they don't. Picture of the hair in the soup below. They need to learn about good customer service because we ordered regularly from them not only for a few of us but for team lunches to be catered in as well and we will not be doing that anymore. I don't normally complain. I never leave bad reviews but this is ridiculous. I didn't ask for our entire order to be comped, they volunteered it and then didn't honor it.", "time": 1548952023}, {"author_name": "Jamin Bailey", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108146890634411333042/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UUDmWAygRiA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAjs/ejfRGNe7pR8/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "Outstanding experience during the lunch rush.\n\nThe line was to the door, but the staff and management kept the service flowing and my food came out perfect.\n\nVery nice facility with plenty of seating, much above average for a Panera.
