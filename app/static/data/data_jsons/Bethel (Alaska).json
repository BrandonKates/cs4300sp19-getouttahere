This dining experience was entertaining from the start. Immediately as you get to the restaurant outside you have beautiful Japanese garden with some gorgeous prize-winning goldfishes. They kids had so much fun looking at them swimming and everything.  After all of that excitement we were able to be seated at a Japanese Hibachi Table with another family and kids so my children had a lot of fun interacting with everyone else around the table. As the chef came in he quickly started his show and it was fun interactive and very energetic. There was so much food!!!! Your portions are very large so make sure you come hungry. the typical Hibachi chicken dinner included rice vegetables and before that you get to have soup and salad. The only reason I took a star of was that the food was not as flavorful or authentic as I am used to but for being Japanese attraction chain spot it was sort of expected to be a little Bland however it was perfect for kiddos taste buds.", "time": 1554090502}, {"author_name": "Jeff Green", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109672358069218060704/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RheUh2K22Dc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAN4s/RNKaEblKRaA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba5/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "The food is surprisingly better than one might think.
