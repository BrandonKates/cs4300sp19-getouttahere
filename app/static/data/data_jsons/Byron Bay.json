Right on the beach, great open area undercover and a cute outdoor patio area. Highly recommend checking out this spot.

I ordered from the kids menu and ordered the fish and chips which was a decent amount with a side salad and it was cheaper than the regular fish and chips and just as filling. \nHighly recommend checking out this spot. \nThe bar is also amazing.
