I've enjoyed events at Peabody Auditorium for years, including the annual production of The Nutcracker Ballet. Last night was Johnny Mathis in concert. Although it's really not my taste in music, it was really good. Partly  because the Peabody is such a great small venue. I have physical limitations myself but thanks to the staff and ushers it was a really nice evening! And it's my understanding that most of the concert staff are volunteers. They were very helpful and seemed well organized\ud83d\ude04",

Actually compared to some parks, their food prices aren't that bad.  Food is nothing special compared to the inventiveness of some parks, but it's ok. If you're a senior citizen, join the Silver Sluggers for about $30 and get a free t-shirt and free parking and admission to 12 games. Great deal. Also includes free soda or cup of coffee each of those games and beer specials.",

I apologized and told her I would clean it, she was adamant that she would clean it up and not to worry about it, all with a genuine smile on her face (I scooped up what I could with napkins anyways). We enjoyed our treat and a young man came to mop up the mess. I apologized and made my girl do the same, he told her no worries accidents happen. So sweet! The vibe in here was very retro and cool. So were the uniforms, so much so we asked for a picture \ud83d\ude02 and he happily obliged. This was a great trip, very welcoming and sincere.",

And the fresh bread was a tad browned too much on the bottom. But still tasty. The atmosphere my not be of this century, but it's supposed to be that way.

Our \"waitress\" finally came to check on us (everything was gone and drinks empty) we asked for a water and menus... Finally got a menu still no water...

Next to a marina, with pleasant views and kind of an out of the way location - right in the middle of things, if that makes any sense.

I usually dread these kinds of evenings, because they can drag on forever, especially when the place is busy like it was for our time there. But I must say the staff absolutely blew away with their promptness and good service. We were in and out within two hours! New record! And we didn't feel rushed or anything.

I got the drunken monk burger and my other half got the morning teak. Burgers where cooked well and had great taste. However the sweet potato tots where under cooked and lacked some form of seasoning (brown sugar & cinnamon or even some sea salt would of been nice). My Onion rings were okay. Seem like they had been sitting a while. This place is like in an apartment area. So don't let the directions throw you off. The burgers were worth the money. They also have a burger challenge there. Maybe I will go for the challenge next time! \ud83d\ude0f",
