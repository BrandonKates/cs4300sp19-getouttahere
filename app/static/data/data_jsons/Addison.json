My pilot also went above and beyond to make my experience fun. He did an amazing job of piloting the aircraft while tending to my experience as well. Top notch piloting! As for the facility and displays, the place is immaculate. The displays are clean and well arranged and it is really noteworthy how nice the aircraft look.
