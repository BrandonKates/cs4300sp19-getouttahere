During a visit you can see a part of historical Memphis. There are photographs, instruments which were used to record actual hit songs, costumes, videos and interactive exhibits. Do you remember the show \"Soul Train\" ? The actual dance floor is there. One of the most amazing exhibits is an actual church which is over 100 years old. Other exhibits change throughout the year. Some of my personal favorite artists associated with Stax were Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and Isaac Hayes. Some of the best videos include Aretha, Marvin Gaye, The Jackson Five, Sam Cooke and the list goes on and on.
