You can never go wrong with samosas! Now for the meal, we ordered 4 orders of naan, two curries; chicken tikka masala and madras. Both lacked flavor and tasted nothing like it should. Super boring..there wasn't anything about it that wowed us. For the naan, each person had 1 full naan which did make sense if it cost $3... that's extremely pricey for plain bread. Now each dish typically comes with a side of rice. For the two curries we had, we got 1 rice to share between 4 people. I honestly don't understand logic. I personally didn't like IndeBlue, the foods overpriced and bland so for that reason I'm giving it 2 stars.",

My guest ordered the All-American platter and he kept raving about the potatoes. If you plan on coming here, check out the website for a coupon that will be sent to your email. It can get busy here so I highly recommend making a reservation. This is a definitely a family style restaurant so large parties are welcome. What ever you do, try to resist the complimentary bread because we made the mistake of eating too much, and couldn\u2019t finish our entrees. This is one of the best options in the area for classic Italian that will far exceed your expectations for a chain establishment.",

I woke up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, and when I turned on the bathroom light, a bug went crawling across the floor. I also was taking the elevator to an event that I was going to the night I stayed there, and the elevator smelled of vomit, and when I told the front desk about it, they just glared at me and said they'd let someone know. It still smelled of vomit 4 hours later. Not to mention that we are almost a month after our stay, and we STILL have yet to receive our deposit of $50 back. I have called 6 times, and have left NUMEROUS voicemails, and still have yet to receive a response.  I was also told my room would be comped for the trouble, and I have yet to see that either.

Said to the waiter that I wanted it cooked medium rare plus and then said maybe it should be medium.  He told me that it cooks very fast and I should order it medium rare.  I said okay and chose to have it cooked without butter.  I like to taste the meat.  You can put butter on feathers and it will taste great.  I guess that when they cook it and add the butter it makes the meat taste better than it really is.  So out comes our dinner and my steak is RARE and not even close to medium rare.   I ate a few bites because I was really hungry and I noticed it had a lot of pepper on it.  I finally flagged down our waiter and showed him the steak.  He agreed that it was rare and offered to bring me a hot plate, whatever good that would do, or take it back and cook it some more, which would probably dry the steak.  Since most of our party was well along in the meal, I opted to finish my steak, which by the way was not that good.  Maybe I should have had the butter.  I have had better meat from Costco prime steaks.  What a waste of money!",

I have a limited tasted for spiciness that I can handle. Nothing in my order was supposedly spicy but the sausage was. Worst part is that the sausage was the first thing I tried and after that all my broth was contaminated with the flavor. So all the rest of the items tasted similar to the sausage.\n\nFor me, sausage (separating if it's or not spicy) it's not the best option to cook on broth and I think they should know better. \n\nNeither the pasta nor the vegetables balls were my favorite.",

We went to get into bed and there was a HUGE stain on the sheet, to the point where we had to pull it off to sleep in the bed. I woke up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, and when I turned on the bathroom light, a bug went crawling across the floor. I also was taking the elevator to an event that I was going to the night I stayed there, and the elevator smelled of vomit, and when I told the front desk about it, they just glared at me and said they'd let someone know. It still smelled of vomit 4 hours later. Not to mention that we are almost a month after our stay, and we STILL have yet to receive our deposit of $50 back. I have called 6 times, and have left NUMEROUS voicemails, and still have yet to receive a response.  I was also told my room would be comped for the trouble, and I have yet to see that either. Will not be staying here again.",

We went to get into bed and there was a HUGE stain on the sheet, to the point where we had to pull it off to sleep in the bed. I woke up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, and when I turned on the bathroom light, a bug went crawling across the floor. I also was taking the elevator to an event that I was going to the night I stayed there, and the elevator smelled of vomit, and when I told the front desk about it, they just glared at me and said they'd let someone know. It still smelled of vomit 4 hours later. Not to mention that we are almost a month after our stay, and we STILL have yet to receive our deposit of $50 back. I have called 6 times, and have left NUMEROUS voicemails, and still have yet to receive a response.  I was also told my room would be comped for the trouble, and I have yet to see that either. Will not be staying here again.",
