After our meal we sat for about 20 minutes and no one acknowledged us. My fiance had to walk up to the register, which was also empty, and wait for someone to return so we could ask for boxes. After we were given boxes we sat for yet another 10 minutes and did not receive our check so eventually we had to go back to the register and wait AGAIN. I understand that they have to keep up with the buffet since it's a large draw, but if tending to the buffet causes them to ignore other paying customers and offer cold food then perhaps they should not even have the option to order off of the menu and do a buffet only.
