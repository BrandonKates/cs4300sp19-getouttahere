We sat in what I think was the lounge area with the small tables in the back. Admittedly the tables were slightly uncomfortable BUT! My wife and I had the greatest time! Your waitresses were more than amazing! And the scallops! Oh my lord those delicious scallops! They were single handedly the best scallops I\u2019ve ever personally had in my life (I lived and worked on the water for over 5 years of my life prior to joining the military in 2014) they were so tender and juicy and exploding with flavor. Not to discount the lobster tail (not nearly as great as the scallops but for Colorado lobster tail it was phenomenal!) and the (what I assume was a dry aged) steak was equally delicious. I want to thank you for making our 3rd Valentine\u2019s Day since we  married the best one so far! We will be making reservations again very very soon and celebrating more life events with you at Le Rouge!!!", "time": 1550241665}, {"author_name": "Connie Amick", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105328785112755951406/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WoK5tKciIog/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAax0/IQLgP6gxTrU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "This restaurant has been one of our favorites in GJ. However, tonight was an utter disappointment. All six of our meals were not good. \nTwo of us had scallops and they were lukewarm and undercooked. The rice was barely lukewarm as well as the vegetable. My husband had the steak and it was all gristle on the outside. Two others in our party had tuna and asked it for it rare. There was no sign of pink anywhere in the little strips of tuna on their plate. \nThe server was unattentive and didn't seem interested in serving us. She wasn't aware of the menu when asked questions. She said she had just got back from vacation so she didn't know. \nSadly we will not ever return to this restaurant. \nWe'll be going back to The Winery restaurant down the street where they know how to cook their food and the service is amazing.", "time": 1551934985}, {"author_name": "Michael C", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116812120449630553898/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Dq-qO53Aw20/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAnPc/2UpVb_EKuEw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "This restaurant is okay if you keep your expectations low.
