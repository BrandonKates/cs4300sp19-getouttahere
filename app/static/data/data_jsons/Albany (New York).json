Our server was friendly, the appetizer was edible and the two drinks we had were decent. \nNow moving on....\nFirst off my husband is a very picky eater, I am not. Nonetheless neither one of us could stomach the entree that was served. \n\nList of issues;\n\n1) The mashed potatoes had turned. \nI almost spit it out, it was so sour and clearly spoiled. \n\n2) Food was lukewarm. \nThis should have been the first clue. They tried to mask the fact it was cold by providing us with hot plates on the side. Oh the irony. \n\n2)Over seasoned asparagus. \nSo I soldiered on to the next part of the meal which were the asparagus, disappointed again. It was way TOO SALTY!!! \n\n3) Chicken was ok but...\nThey had some kind of chipotle chocolate glaze on top. It would have been alright had it not been drowned in the sauce. The poor frozen cutlet never had a chance. \n\nWhen we brought it to our server's attention she took our plates full of food and said she'd check with the cook only to come back to offer us a $4 piece of cake or $12 drink in replace of a nearly $30 entree. \nSo in a nutshell we only had one appetizer and two drinks and paid nearly $70.00+ tip for a horrible meal. To top it all off we still have to pay for dinner at the next place because we're still hungry.\nYou've been warned!!!",

I order at least once a week from work and have encouraged co-workers to also order from here. To my disappointment, when we ordered tonight they denied us the coupon for spending over $35. because we ordered a combo,( which is pretty much as ordering reg sushi rolls), when in fact we were spending over $40. We then changed our order, then it went up to over $50 and all we got was the free roll that was for the orders over $35 instead of offering us what we should've received. I'm good to be honest, I just wish this restaurant would recognize to give a little when ppl spend a lot. The icing on the cake for me was/is when ordering I need to tell them that each item is separate, when this should kind of be assumed when making a large order. It was crazy uncomfortable to not only not have plates but to have to share containers. \n\nTonight will be the last time I spend one dime at this establishment.",

Cocktails were a little small, but packed a punch and were carefully put together and soo flavorful. Prices are very fair. Entree's were perfectly cooked and delicious. Service was great. They are doing an awesome job here!! My one suggestion is, they should work on a new sign for the location. The sign doesn't speak well for the absolute fabulous place this is. Plus a new sign may stand out more, catching more traffic from Western Avenue. Will absolutely be back :)",
