I got there and wandered through the back area for a bit and looked at some of the area where they grow grapes, and then walked into the area where they do tastings. Because the weather was so gorgeous, they offered us seats outside which was so lovely! The seating area is covered, which is nice because the sun was a bit bright, and the tables and decor are so cute!\n\nOnto the tasting - GOOD DEAL. $10 for 5 wines, plus they did a complimentary one at the end! And you get to keep your glass! What a deal. And the pours? GENEROUS. Definite tip: if you're planning on driving afterwards, plan to spend at least an hour here or eat something while drinking.\n\nSpeaking of eating, they offer a cheese plate ($5 per person) and it's pretty tasty!\n\nI'd go back here in a heartbeat, especially if the weather is nice.",

After a bit of a discussion they came up with the last three tastes but we ended up with the same wines again. The wine wasn\u2019t bad but their knowledge of wine and sequencing for tasting leaves a lot to be desired. Save your time.  Not worth the stop. They lack a lot in terms of a winery experience. The ladies doing the pouring were more like bartenders than knowledgeable wine folks.",

Recommend doing the stations set up for food for the variety, abundance, and affordability (did mention it comes with an all you can eat raw bar?!). If you book a Saturday day wedding, it is much cheaper because they usually charge extra for the room if you book their Saturday evening wedding slot. Very spacious. Good sized dance floor. They also have several wedding coordinators to make sure your day is perfect and on your wedding day, you have your own personal server who makes sure you get whatever food or drink you want so you don't even miss out on cocktail hour appetizers! As a wedding revenue, would give this place 5 stars. Have also eaten at the restaurant and would give the restaurant 4 stars mostly due to the service being a bit slow. Excellent clam chowder.",

Although the pastry seemed purchased, the filling was apparently made on the premises. There were 4 small sweets,just enough to top off a meal. We each had a cup of clam chowder which was also good. It was enough for the two of us &we took the sweets with us to nibble on later. I only wish the tea pot had been large enough for us each to have 2 full cups.",
