Also the portions we average and expensive. I could go to Carrabas and spend less money. The way I see it mom and pop shops can be more expensive than chain restaurants but they have to offer higher quality food or service , more authentic dishes, better seasoning, a better environment or something to set them apart. As there front facade that is still unfinished after years of remodeling suggest they are close but have yet to reach the finish line. Maybe they will find a niche soon. Maybe the outside seating area will stop looking like a construction site soon. I\u2019ve live here for 5 years and I\u2019ve been saying maybe soon for longer than I should. But I feel they will either figure it out or go out of business. I\u2019m rooting for them to win. Every year or so I try them again with high hopes.",

The service was quick, especially when she could tell we like to eat and run. \nThe food was about a 3.8. No gourmet but good.  We got the kids burger and mac and cheese (both were eaten and enjoyed by the kids.) We also got a sandwich and a salad. Next time, I'll stay away from the salad and stick to a more bar-type item, I think I'll have better luck.\nThe next time we went, the power was out, so no food, but we got to hang on the back deck and get a beer. My son loves watching the trains come in, and a lot of the outdoor seating is covered, so I didnt need to worry about sunscreen. \nOverall, WE WILL BE BACK. I'd love to sit outside again and try some different food. \nUpdate pending. \ud83e\udd1e",

Unfortunately the food was mediocre.  We started with salmon tacos and I'm still concerned that we,ll be sick from the aged salmon. The spinach quiche was excellent. It was mostly spinach and mushroom and the texture was perfect. The buffalo buffalo beef cake was hard to cut through, but the pickled celery was tasty. Next we had the potato skins.  These were very sloppy Joe's on half a baked potato.  The cheese tray was tasty but certainly not 16 dollars tasty for four sugar cubes of cheese. Overall the $180 price tag left us feeling like we should have gone elsewhere.",

We were at the back bar for a good 2 hours and between everyone we spent around $600. The back bartender was great and we were all minding our business and hanging out within our group. We were all walking out to leave and one of the servers was sent over by the manager to us telling us we were being kicked out? He didn\u2019t have any reasoning behind it other then he was told one of us fell (which is false) and that we could talk to the manager about it. When we asked the manager about it he was standing at the front with his arms crossed and a smug look on his face and wouldn\u2019t even talk to us and just told us to get out. Glad to know you can spend tons of money at an establishment and still be treated so horrible. Will never be going back there and will never recommend.",

                "text": "A group of friends and I went on Saturday night after hanging out in Doylestown for a bit. We were at the back bar for a good 2 hours and between everyone we spent around $600. The back bartender was great and we were all minding our business and hanging out within our group. We were all walking out to leave and one of the servers was sent over by the manager to us telling us we were being kicked out? He didn\u2019t have any reasoning behind it other then he was told one of us fell (which is false) and that we could talk to the manager about it. When we asked the manager about it he was standing at the front with his arms crossed and a smug look on his face and wouldn\u2019t even talk to us and just told us to get out. Glad to know you can spend tons of money at an establishment and still be treated so horrible. Will never be going back there and will never recommend.",

The problem is that my wife's meal (chicken with a side of pasta - pasta being the main reason to eat here, and what she was most looking forward to) didn't come out when mine and my two sons' did.  Well, the chicken did, but not the pasta.  We promptly asked for it, and were told it was coming right out.  It wasn't.  It didn't come for at least another 15 minutes, delivered by someone else, at which time we were all finished and told him to just box it.  The waitress came back, oblivious to the fact that it wasn't on the table in front of us as we were getting ready to leave, even though we had reminded her earlier that we were waiting on it. \n\nOnly other criticism - the wine pour is weak...maybe 4 oz.  For a generic $10 glass of white.\n\nFood is decent, but just do takeout...",
