We are huge animal lovers and have visited many zoo but this one is probably the best as far as the encounters go it's not crowded and u can actually see and take wonderful pics without being pushed and worked through crowds. They are adding on, and more animals are too come so I cant wait to visit again in the future! Great work Chattanooga Zoo.",

While it\u2019s not one of those big zoos, it has a nice variety of animals like red pandas, snow leopards, Jaguars, chimpanzees, and camels. Not to mention the giraffe coming soon. It had a nice appearance and the people were nice. I especially enjoyed the indoor areas. They had unique indoor creatures too like sloths, iguanas and foxes.

It's nice that they have a pool and playground now but some of the other changes are not so good. No outside food and their food prices are outrageous. $8 for a bag of popcorn and $3 for a bottled water  All they have in the petting zoo are goats.. at least one of which was pregnant and cranky. Actually tried to nip.  A couple of other animals nearby that weren't available to the kids. I was surprised by how few animals they actually had. And I seriously dislike being forced to leave through the gift shop. Are they so hard up for funds? Try explaining to a 5 year old why you can't spend $24 on two stuffed animals.",

Some of the highlights here were an area dedicated to dinosaurs with an excavation pit kids could dig in, a building area to make robots, a lookout tower, and an area on the roof that demonstrates simple machines. My kids wanted to move on after about 3 or so hours, partly because how many other kids were there and in the case of my 10 year old there wasn't as much for her age to keep her attention. They offer a generous military discount and the staff genuinely seemed to enjoy their jobs.",

Ordered a second round and both drinks were wrong. It took another ten minutes after that to get the check despite.  At this point, I do not ever want to step foot in another Taco Mac. My money will be spent elsewhere and I encourage anyone that actually knows their beer to stay away as well.   And to add, the tables around us weren't bussed the entire time we were there.",

                "text": "We came from Georgia where I first encountered this chain. Over there the pizza was amazing. Simply to die for. And when we moved here I was so excited to see that there was a location near us. We drove from Lafayette to dine here because we loved the locations in Georgia so much. I was so disappointed. More like heartbroken. Our buffalo pizza stopped being made halfway up the pizza leaving a thick piece of crust. Our bbq chicken side was burnt. We asked for no onions on both sides there were onions. The crust was not like the other locations. It was hard. My son got the pretzel bites the only good thing that came to our table. It's what I expected my crust on my pizza to be. Our waitress forgot about us once it got busy. The host was the only reason this place got 2 stars. She was amazing and so friendly with my son. I think it needs to meet the management at other locations. Next time we will wait till I visit my in laws in Georgia. Such a huge let down. And dont tell me about it being burnt because it goes into an oven when 2 completely different locations have the same crust and same quality of food on the opposite sides of Georgia. There's something not right with this location.",

No toppings anymore!!! The once famous and fabulous huge burger with all the toppings is now just a 1/3 lb fast food burger. The super large fry is now a small basket.  While the burger was good, it isn't a burger I would go out of my way to eat. We have made this trip many times a year for 9 years. Can't say as I see us ever going back.",

We ordered big, our food was fresh, timely, accurate, and the service was fantastic. They kindly let us stay a half hour after close while we were mindful of not overstaying our welcome. Our shakes to-go were tasty, very visually appealing and absolutely amazing, big and quality was worth the price. Big tasty burgers, great apps, impressive list of cold beer. The onion rings are to die for. Very sweet service here. Thank you for letting us enjoy our visit!!!!!",

Let me start by saying this venue is incredibly beautiful inside and outside, it was perfect for our outdoor fall wedding.  The owner was completely useless to us, we only actually met her one time and had to meet her assistant for any issues. We could get over not meeting with the owner but one month before our wedding we were told we would no longer have use of their linens or china, this was a nightmare and we had no time or money to get a new venue. We ended up buying our own table cloths and some china and using plastic china from Walmart and dollar tree which was heart breaking after having my heart set on china for everyone. On our wedding day we got to the venue and it was FILTHY! our wedding party had to scrub tables and sweep the floor before we could set anything up, not to mention you could stick to the nasty floor and see trash overflowing from outside! I sent the owner a text before we cleaned to see if we could get the cleaning crew to come in but she didn't respond until we had already cleaned up. Someone did finally come in to \"clean\" but mostly just ran around yelling at our wedding party and families who were cleaning. We even had to blow leaves so we could walk down the isle which we were yelled at for because they claimed they were going to come back and do that later. Our family members took over set up from there so we could go relax and get dressed but it just got worse, Come to find out this cleaning person was still running around yelling and had called the manager claiming we had broken down doors and stolen china and linens, I ended up getting a very rude call from the owner while getting ready and after being accused of breaking down doors and taking things we didn't I was enraged! We even had all the receipts just in case but nothing else was ever said. Despite the drama with the venue our wedding was beautiful and we enjoyed our day despite their attempt to ruin it. ",

Can't complain about that, but the service and demeanor of the people who work there will ensure that I never step foot in this establishment again.  I had obtained a living social offer, and was greeting with aggression obtaining it.  We had two of the deals that are prepaid for, and were going to use them both.  The owner was telling us that we could not use them both, in which case we said we would pay the difference.  He continued on telling us that for six orders would be one table, when in reality there are no tables in the building, that I saw, that could seat 6 people.  When we informed him that we would sit 3 to a table he got even more infuriated.  He then proceeded to tell us that he had to make money too.  Why put an offer or coupon available to the public if you don't want it used. We asked what the difference was for the one we were going to use to which he replied don't worry about it and he walked off.  We left both vouchers at the register and left, without our drinks, but it was already uncomfortable and shouldn't have happened.  So I say, food is good, service and temperament not worth dealing it with so many other options.  ",

While their menu is small, I thoroughly enjoy it. The few things they do offer, they excel in. \n\nThe ribeye with the goat cheese whipped potatoes and the seasonal risotto has my mouth watering as soon as I walk in the door. They certainly know how to cook a steak there. The staff is always coming by to check on you and making sure your drinks are always full, but they don't overburden you either. It's a very remarkable line they walk. \n\nThe bar keepers knows many different types and styles of drinks, and are quiet exceptional at making them. They have a huge cocktail list, and the prices are reasonable too. \n\nWhy you would pay the same price at Longhorns or Outback is beyond me. If you haven't visited this place yet.

Immediately as you get to the restaurant outside you have beautiful Japanese garden with some gorgeous prize-winning goldfishes. They kids had so much fun looking at them swimming and everything.  After all of that excitement we were able to be seated at a Japanese Hibachi Table with another family and kids so my children had a lot of fun interacting with everyone else around the table. As the chef came in he quickly started his show and it was fun interactive and very energetic. There was so much food!!!! Your portions are very large so make sure you come hungry. the typical Hibachi chicken dinner included rice vegetables and before that you get to have soup and salad. The only reason I took a star of was that the food was not as flavorful or authentic as I am used to but for being Japanese attraction chain spot it was sort of expected to be a little Bland however it was perfect for kiddos taste buds.",

Very slow, salads didn't come out until the food was done, only half of the party got them in the first place. Soup was even later. Most of, if not everyone sat with empty glasses the entire time.   Just was not the best experience at all. When management was approached. Not to get anyone in trouble, but to let them know they were full of it they weren't very apologetic. To top it all off the server put gratuity on everyone's check. For a second day at work, he knew he sucked and still decides to charge us an extra 18 percent. He didn't deserve it.

Over a half hour goes by and out comes my steak..... no salad... no big deal just asked them to forget the salad(appetizer) when I cut into the steak which was ordered medium it was medium well, almost well done.\nSo long story short, I know as a server you hate single diners but we eat too and a little secret we usually tip quite well. ( at least I do)\nSo pay attention to the big parties and keep ignoring your loyal customers.\nNow I guess it's off to find food.",

This is the second time it has happened where they have like twelve empty tables but they refuse to sit people because their kitchen is backed up or whatever. I mean seriously? Let's have people stand up and not even get drinks because our back of the house is poorly run? If they weren't the only place in Lookout Valley they'd be closed. The managers need to go work in another industry because they don't understand service.\n\nThen it gets worse. We're finally seated, and we're seated as far away from TV's as possible. We ask can't we just sit at one of those other 12-15 empty tables closer to a TV. The hostess says she will check, then she comes back and says no. What is going on with this place?\n\nIn the end I decided they weren't worth my money and we just ordered drinks until the game was finished and went and ate somewhere else. That is how bad the customer service was here, I decided I would rather drive somewhere else to eat just to deprive them of revenue I felt they didn't deserve.",

Immediately as you get to the restaurant outside you have beautiful Japanese garden with some gorgeous prize-winning goldfishes. They kids had so much fun looking at them swimming and everything.  After all of that excitement we were able to be seated at a Japanese Hibachi Table with another family and kids so my children had a lot of fun interacting with everyone else around the table. As the chef came in he quickly started his show and it was fun interactive and very energetic. There was so much food!!!! Your portions are very large so make sure you come hungry. the typical Hibachi chicken dinner included rice vegetables and before that you get to have soup and salad. The only reason I took a star of was that the food was not as flavorful or authentic as I am used to but for being Japanese attraction chain spot it was sort of expected to be a little Bland however it was perfect for kiddos taste buds.",

Anything you order here will have you moaning in delight. The staff is so attentive, the music is very peaceful, & they took a lot of time to create a fine dining experience. As if there wasn't enough good things to say, the prices are very within budget! My dinner entree was about $10-11. The portions are plenty. Lastly, I want to say everytime I've been to Sweet Basil, it's been this same amazing experience.",

When we get there, items on the website we\u2019re not available, nor on the menu at all!!  What was on the menu was lack luster and disappointing.  I love tapas and the small bites of deliciousness...this place did not deliver.  Lobster bisque was fishy tomato liquid no lobster anywhere.  Cheese platter was disappointing and the blue puff was heavy and dense not light as it should be. Wine was great though!! They need to represent their actual menu on their website so you know what to expect. I would not recommend eating here.",
