In the Civil War exhibit, there's a 360\u00b0 movie that I've now seen at least three times all the way through and a couple times some of the way through, but every time I see it, I see something new. If flashing lights or gunfire cause reactions for you, you're better off avoiding the movie, but there's still plenty to see. I loved the parts that focused on medicine in the 1860s. There is an entrance fee and it'll be more if you're not a Kenosha resident. The gift shop has some amusing gifts but also period-appropriate pieces, like hat pins, for instance. There's a huge parking lot and it's right on the lake within walking distance of more entertainment and food. I think my absolute favorite room was the library upstairs. My daughter's favorite place was probably the balcony upstairs - outside.
