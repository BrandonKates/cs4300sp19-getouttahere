Salad first: standard side salad - lettuce mix and 1 grape tomato. Main course: I had the catfish - well cooked and tasty - with veggies which were your standard frozen, out-of-the-bag with a bechamel-type sauce. Those around me who had the steak or chicken said that you got caught tastes of lighter fluid in addition to over-char on both and I also heard the sauce on the chicken was a bit salty. Dessert: both adequate but left something to be desired. The bread pudding (which does have raisins) had no texture; it was quite literally mushy bread with a hint of cinnamon compacted into a pan and baked. The baked fudge was strange. A hybrid of fudge and cake, it was lacking a rich chocolate flavor that I expected, but in fact so does much fudge. It works have been better served as a smaller portion with a scoop of ice cream. All in all for the price and the hype of the place I was sorely disappointed and will not be returning.
