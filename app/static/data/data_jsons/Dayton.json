It's like a bar, restaurant, arcade, and museum all at the same time.There are lots of cool arcade games and they are all free except the pinball machine, which cost more to maintain. This place is kid friendly with an adult up to a certain time, so maybe call ahead if you are traveling. The food is amazing, compliments to the chef, and they have a good selection of craft, domestic, and import beers. The bartender, Becky, was very cool and knows her stuff behind the bar. She is a fun person to talk to. Again, very cool place, I really enjoyed the experience.", "time": 1550864834}, {"author_name": "Jacob Kilpatrick", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100360096177023923121/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DYd-3cyX40Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGqY/zNUE3jqFKKE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "I had the best Italian sandwich I've ever had in my life here today!
