Our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable. Lots of volunteers who are very passionate. Also saw a bald eagle and coyotes. \n\nIf you have time after or before, go to kellys hot springs ~20 minutes away where buffalo and other wildlife congregate.",

Like many of the galleries in the area we found yours closed on multiple occasions, and some others also inconsistently with their posted hours (and the notice of an \"installation\" was not informative); and we were quite frustrated as our time in the area was limited.  By contrast, one gallery was open each time we went by, and we ended up purchasing a piece of artwork there.  This review  simply reflected our experience, as do the other reviews I have posted, whether positive or negative.",

First we ordered couple cocktails, which were great , then  for appetizers we had  Fried Calamari and Beef Tacos. Calamari were really good and beef taco was just okay (little dry). We\u2019ve been waiting pretty long for entree\u2019s (about 40 min after appetizers). We got our Veal Marsala and Steak Frites. I ordered steak well done, but it was really BURNED and tasted so bitter and dry.  Steak comes with house-made fries, but it doesn\u2019t taste good either. Fries is so thin. Veal Marsala tasted better, but still nothing special. Now it\u2019s off season in Jackson and they have great deal $2 for second entree, so this made our check look much better. Prices are normal. $13-$14 for each appetizer, steak is $34 and $33 for Veal Marsala. Service was okay. After all, we got not so good impression about this place.",

I went back the next morning.  Unfortunately, the store does not do returns, which is a shame since they were selling damaged products.  I could not exchange them for the same item because all the figurines they had left were chipped, too.  So I had to find other items to make up the exchange.  I settled on a shirt and pen.  The cashiers working there are very young women who speak very softly and quietly and are lacking in customer service skills.  It doesn't help that music is blaring loudly all of the time.  It took  30 minutes for these cashiers to do the math and figure out the exchange and process it on their computers/registers.  It shouldn't have been that complicated.  I had to get out my phone calculator to help. It was frustrating to spend all that time doing a store exchange that should have been relatively simple rather than being out enjoying the beautiful sites.",
