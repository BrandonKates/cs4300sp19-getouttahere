I don't give a hoot about the healthy organic all natural buzzword food. Personally, it's overrated, overpriced, and not worth it. But that bakery? I will eat all 1000 calories of that tiny little cake. No regrets. \nGood selection of cheese, great place for fresh meat and local coffee. \n\nAlso, there seems to be bar soap everywhere. Really.. it seemed every 2-3 aisles there was a display for some sort of soap. So much so that I'm beginning to think that this Whole Foods location is trying to tell us we smell bad.

My only problem with it is the pricing. Yes, it is still a little less expensive than cheesecakes at fine-dining restaurants. But, I adamantly believe that the pricing should reflect what it is - a walk-in bakery. I recommend shopping around Little Italy for more reasonably-priced cheesecakes (what Eileen's Cheesecake used to be before it became too famous).\n\nI bought 20 different flavors, and gave some to 2 other friends. At the same time, I felt ripped off and thought, \"I will never come back again\". This is not the kind of impression I had hoped from Eileen's Cheesecake.

Sadly, most posts on sites like Yelp are instigated by exceptionally good or bad service, and this falls into the latter.  I have lived in 41 River Terrace for four years, and have never been treated so poorly by an employee, anywhere, as I was today at Terry's Deli. I have spoken to management and await decisive action, but until then, encourage everyone to select a new deli - such as the 24 hour deli just 100 feet down the block.\n\nThe issue started out very small with a problem that has occurred more frequently than it should. A sandwich I purchased was missing an ingredient - in this case the tuna in my tuna sandwich. I begrudgingly returned to the store to have it added, when the real problems began. The sandwich maker immediately chided me that it was I who made the mistake and did not tell him to add tuna. Instead, I had only requested vegetable toppings, no meat, on my sandwich. For context, I'm a man in my 30's, I also bought a muscle milk, and the only sandwich I order there is a tuna sandwich - every time!  I tried to brush this off, and also pointed out that I had not forgotten to tell the cashier I paid for a tuna sandwich, and for which I was charged. I was still willing to let this treatment roll off my back, but he insisted I admit I was wrong before he would fix my sandwich, and became angry about it, complete with expletive. At this point, I voiced my displeasure and requested his name and to speak with management. I was told his name is \"Mr. Nobody\" and management is not available, nor is there a phone number. This strikes me as an unusual way to manage! Sadly, other employees whom I know for a long time stood by and watched this unfold, unwilling to intervene, or offer a name and number for the manager, either.\n\nWhat this made me reflect on is the following. Without accountability in the store, and a respect for members of our community, what other disagreeable things are likely going on behind the scenes? Are they responsible stewards of our families and children who trust Terry's to provide wholesome food and other products at reasonable prices? Out of respect for this Trinidad family-owned business and the other delis they operate in NYC, and for the vast majority of the staff whom I have befriended over the years, I am refraining from further action. It turns out Mr. Nobody does have a first and last name, and it's on the lips of management right now. I am awaiting swift and decisive action to convince me that they do care about our community and their patrons. Terminating Mr. Nobody's employment, and visibly educating staff that there exists an obligation to care for and respect community members would be a good start. In the meantime, I will be shopping elsewhere and suggest community members do the same.\n\n", "time": 1368996661}, {"author_name": "Mark SAGoN", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115957963898597537054/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SvsQuGm4YXM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3regu_59P-0V-LZWNURBSlQim4mgIw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 1, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "one off the employees put pepper in my bbq sauce every time i go the he offer me pepper i would refuse so he put it in my bbq sauce that is not nice", "time": 1505346875}, {"author_name": "Dror Perk", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117089499849457169510/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cC6kb1jNN4w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc5fnCBk3xB3rkkM1ZxQTDm2W1xKg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "5 years ago", "text": "The place to go for Stuyvesant kids.

I purchased them right from my phone once I saw the line to purchase tickets. \n\nThe line waiting for an empty ferry is actually quite long on a daily basis, they do have more than one ferry transporting back and forth which makes the line move a little faster. There is only so much room on the ferry and on a hot day, the wait can be miserable in the sun so be sure to squeeze into the crowd when boarding the boat to ensure you're part of the cut off, having to wait for the next ferry. \n\nThe ferry ride is relaxing and on a hot day can help to cool you off. Looking at lady upon approach to the island liberty closeup is something quite spectacular and considering the difficulty they faced in getting the foundation of the statute initially built, its even more amazing closeup. \n\nThe tour will also take you to Ellis Island which is well worth the time and extremely informational. The old hospital on the island is also really cool to see and they do have a tour which would allow you to see parts of the old hospital which I at some point will have to do. I thoroughly enjoy spending time on Ellis island not just for the history lesson and opportunity to get a close up of the awesome architecture but also just sit back and look across the water at the magnificent skyline. \n\nThis is a good relaxing way to spend the afternoon.\nCheers!", "time": 1551520623}, {"author_name": "Kerry O'connor", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104260116240745931977/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8rVa1jZrn5k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfZzUbwoOdBdso6docdl4udfnurUw/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "What a fantastic place, the wax model's are very serial.

I typically order a Diet Coke and it is served from the bar so I know that the house is making a big profit when charging 3.50 per glass.  I normally don't mind because I get refills and get charged once.  Tonight, not only did I have to ask, twice, for the initial drink, he never bothered to check on us, I had to flag him down for a (single) refill and then when he brought the bill, I discovered that I had been charged for that refill.  7 bucks for two glasses of Diet Coke is outrageous, even for the Upper West side of NYC.\n\nTo add to the mess from tonight, I ordered a half chicken, I got a part of a let and a bit of breast... Not the whole thing.  Now, I don't blame the server for that but I do blame him for this - I asked for a substitute of vegetables INSTEAD of the mashed potatoes that typically come with the chicken, normally I get a double size portion of vegetables, which I happily pay a couple dollars extra for.  Tonight, I got a single portion of asparagus which I was charged the same thing as when there's a substitute! \n\nAdditionally, the server came to the table not at all after taking our order.  He made no attempt to check on us, no refills of water, never asked if we wanted dessert, basically he did nothing but scribble down our order.  He's the tall blonde with a kind of heavy accent - not a French accent though.  Avoid him if you can!

Do not expect wet out-of-a-can pasta and sauce. The side of broccoli rabe was very copious and well seasoned.  They had a special of white sangria pitcher for $10 dollars (AMAZING). So we were able to have a great dinner for two for about $50 dollars, something we really liked as we were on a budget vacation and we prefer to spend our money wisely on quality experiences.\n\nThe ambiance is calm and cozy.
