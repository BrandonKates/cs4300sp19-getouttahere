My Fiance had the pesto fettuccine with chicken, I had the chef salad. Decent portions. My Fiance loved her dish and was only able to eat half. My salad was loaded, very tasty and completely filled me up. The iced tea was good too. Definitely worth the price for what you receive.",

The special -- we always go for the special! -- Oregon Bay shrimp over fettuccini in a sherry cream sauce, was delicious, the pasta exactly on point and the sauce rich but not unctuous. Luckily, we still had room for Wiley's delicious light chocolate mousse. In a town with puffed-up eateries intended to fleece the play-goers, Wiley's is worth a short trip uptown.

I ordered some sort of sausage ravioli, my girlfriend ordered salmon ravioli and it was all definitely frozen, even the sauce tasted like it was from a jar.

                "text": "I have eaten at the Dragonfly 3 times in the past several years. They have a marvelous ambience, the garden dining is well landscaped and very pleasant, the food is excellent, and the service is awful. My first bad experience was years ago, I don't recall the 2nd time, so say it was ok, and lets get to today.  Today my wife and I arrived at 12:30 pm with a 1:30 play time at the nearby Oregon Shakespeare Festival. No one admitted once the performance starts. I told the waitress this when we were seated, in part because the menu itself said service was slow due to the excellence of their food preparation. Notify the waitress if you have a deadline, it suggested, and \"we'll try to accomodate you.\" Considering that they are two blocks from the Shakespeare theaters which are the major tourist draw of the town, you'd think that they understood theater deadlines. Still, with a 45 minute window to get a meal, it looked like a shoo-in. The more so as I ordered a cup of soup of the day - how long could that take? - and my wife ordered a tamale with no options. Thirty minutes later, at 1 p.m., no food. We had to leave at 1:15 to reach our theater seats, so I told the waitress bring the bill, we're going. She assured me that the food was coming right up, and within 2 or 3 minutes it appeared. We had 12 minutes to enjoy their specially excellent food preparation. So lunch filled our physical needs for food but not our esthetic needs for time to enjoy the pleasures of eating it. It can not take 30 minutes to make a tamale and pour a cup of soup, and their service is so routinely slow that they have to warn you on the menu. Astonishing. I suggest you only go to the Dragonfly when you are not yet hungry and have nothing on your agenda for a couple of hours. Don't worry, you'll be hungry before you get served.",

They actually chastised me and insinuated that I had no idea what I was talking about when I said my play started at 1:30pm, telling me instead that it started at 2:00pm. First, they were wrong to correct me in the way that they did upon me asking if my food would appear before my play as I had already been waiting an hour, then they were wrong to tell me the wrong time. What if I had believed them and then missed my play? A table of 3, that's three play tickets at $90 per ticket -- i.e. a lot more expensive than lunch at this inconsistent and rude restaurant.",

Wow, this ended up becoming one of the best stays I\u2019ve ever had. The room was amazing, with just about every amenity (including bath robes, kettle to boil water for tea, etc) one can think of. Everything was immaculate and the bed was divine. There were even fresh pastries in the room. If it had ended right there, I would already have given 5 stars. But wait, they provide complimentary breakfast and it was truly one of the best breakfast I\u2019ve ever had. Everything is freshly made and I asked for extra poached eggs on the side, and didn\u2019t even get charged for it. Service was absolutely amazing, and Rachel was very attentive and accommodating. As if that all wasn\u2019t enough, after I checked out, I was even offered the kitchen sink to wash out my dirty coffee bottle (I left it in the car overnight). I\u2019m so, so impressed with the entire experience. I wish I could give it 10 stars.",

Food in bar and breakfast were 3-4 stars, better last time we stayed a year ago. But good atmosphere and exceptional service. Location is perfect, 2 blocks walk to the playhouses and on a quiet street. Plenty of parking. We will be back to Winchester every year.",

Wow, this ended up becoming one of the best stays I\u2019ve ever had. The room was amazing, with just about every amenity (including bath robes, kettle to boil water for tea, etc) one can think of. Everything was immaculate and the bed was divine. There were even fresh pastries in the room. If it had ended right there, I would already have given 5 stars. But wait, they provide complimentary breakfast and it was truly one of the best breakfast I\u2019ve ever had. Everything is freshly made and I asked for extra poached eggs on the side, and didn\u2019t even get charged for it. Service was absolutely amazing, and Rachel was very attentive and accommodating. As if that all wasn\u2019t enough, after I checked out, I was even offered the kitchen sink to wash out my dirty coffee bottle (I left it in the car overnight). I\u2019m so, so impressed with the entire experience. I wish I could give it 10 stars.",

Room was clean and had treats and turn down service. Carpet could use a shampoo clean. Our bed was a bit jiggly  when one of us rolled over, but not unusual for a mattress over springs. Food in bar and breakfast were 3-4 stars, better last time we stayed a year ago. But good atmosphere and exceptional service. Location is perfect, 2 blocks walk to the playhouses and on a quiet street. Plenty of parking. We will be back to Winchester every year.",
