Many public museums make these items available for public viewing through\u00a0exhibitsthat may be permanent or temporary.[1]\u00a0The largest museums are located in major cities throughout the world, while thousands of local museums exist in smaller cities, towns and rural areas. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the\u00a0general public.\n\nThere are many types of museums, including art museums, natural history museums, science museums, war museums, and children's museums. Amongst the world's largest and most visited museums are the\u00a0Louvre\u00a0in\u00a0Paris, the\u00a0National Museum of China\u00a0in\u00a0Beijing, the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0in\u00a0Washington, D.C., the\u00a0British Museum\u00a0and\u00a0National Gallery\u00a0in London, the\u00a0Metropolitan Museum of Art\u00a0in\u00a0New York City\u00a0and\u00a0Vatican Museums\u00a0in\u00a0Vatican City. According to The World Museum Community, there are more than 55,000 museums in 202 countries.[2]\n\nEtymologyEdit\n\n\ufffc\n\nThe\u00a0State Historical Museum\u00a0in\u00a0Moscow.\n\nThe English \"museum\" comes from the\u00a0Latinword, and is pluralized as \"museums\" (or rarely, \"musea\").
