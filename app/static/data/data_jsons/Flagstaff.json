There were two to three pieces of half inch square-sized pieces of chicken per slice.  And the cheese was limited at best.  We were just so disappointed.

I decided with the wife to try it again after many years. The only thing I was not disappointed in was the ah gratin potatoes( those are really good)  The steak was over cooked. We ordered med, got a steak that was med well to well done. The char finish was not the \"bold\" finish the server said. The salad bar was a little wilted.  The Carmel cookie?  Was uninspired, felt like a cheap rip off of Oregano's pazokie.   Service was OK but not great( i still tipped) But with a bill of right about $93? I left not particularly angry or upset, just underwhelmed.",
