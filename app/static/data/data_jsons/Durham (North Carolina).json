They have a good collection from the Americas. There are some interesting Roman pieces too. There is a really interesting photography exhibit from Hugh Mangum that we enjoyed. That's a recent addition to the general collection and it's worth seeing.\n\nWhy only 3 stars? As regular plebians (read: not Duke alumni) we had to pay $7/person to get in for what was barely an hour of looking around. I actually read every card on the wall and spent some time looking more seriously at a few pieces and we still barely spent an hour there. We also had to pay to park in the lot.
