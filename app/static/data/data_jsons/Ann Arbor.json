Remember that the President Form MUSEUM is not here; it's in Grand Rapids MI. Most people assume the two facilities are co-located, and Ford's are not. As a Presidential library, this is a great facility with material, research rooms, and related space; BUT it also has some conference and meeting rooms, and there's a small amount of view-able, \"museum-like\" material as well. A Presidential library a lot like Ford himself: low-key and functional but with some nice touches that enhance things.", "time": 1512595547}, {"author_name": "Andy Helms", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106448434440549040944/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3pQLVK5wpQ4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAcw/IwJB7OePhFU/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a year ago", "text": "This was great as a short stop while in town for another reason.

My 5 year old was completely amazed by it, I wouldn\u2019t have brought him in if he was loud to disrupt anyone, he said ooh wow cool in a normal talking not loud voice because he was amazed by it and the rude guy presenting scolded him twice to be quiet that it\u2019s disruptive and s third time he signaled to my son to zip it again when he was whispering to me to look at something that interested him so my son couldn\u2019t be excited to learn here and couldn\u2019t even whisper.. actually the presenter was louder when scolding my son so he was the one being disruptive. Apparently kids can\u2019t go in and be amazed at what they see or well express it for that matter. It\u2019s not like he was acting up, screaming or throwing a tantrum because I would have walked him out if he was plus he wasn\u2019t continuously talking which we understood plus he understood not to talk when someone else is talking but a quick expression of excitement a couple times from a child is to be expected.  I think this was the worst experience we have had here and won\u2019t be back because of it. Kids can\u2019t be excited to learn here which is sad. Here is a tip, don\u2019t hire people who are not kid friendly. We were sitting closest to the man presenting at the time which is why he was able to hear him at all.  After the show we had a couple other people approach us and complimented how adorable our son was and that it was great as to how amazed he was and how rude the student was giving the presentation. Why is this even acceptable here?\n\nHe really has his heart set on working for NASA when he gets big and sure he may change his mind as many and most do but kids shouldn\u2019t have their love for something crushed due to some uptight people.

I tried them for the first time last night and will not return. I stopped in for carryout pizza by the slice for my boyfriend and me. First of all, the layout of the restaurant is dysfunctional. The kitchen/working area is so small, I don't know how the three employees were able to move around. And that's another thing. The floor behind the counter has plastic pallets on it and the employees were walking around on the pallets. It was one of the strangest things I've ever seen in a pizza place. The cash register is on a small counter where other customers were just standing around waiting for their orders, so it was impossible to try to place my order and pay. After forcing my way to the register, I ordered two cheese and two pepperoni slices. The cashier could barely figure out how to price them. Cheese and pepperoni are the most basic thing you can order! There were two other customers waiting for their orders and the staff was clearly confused who was supposed to get what order. The employees were running around manically and acting like they could barely comprehend what was going on in the store with three customers! I also noticed there was no hand washing going on as food was being handled. No employee had a clear designated spot to work. They were all just doing whatever. Who manages like that? When I finally received my order they only gave me three slices. I repeated my order of two cheese and two pepperoni. A few minutes later I received my order in a small box and thought to myself \"how in the world are there four slices of New York style pizza in here? Did the employee stack them on top of each other?\" I was so annoyed I walked out to my car, opened the box, and guess what? Three slices of pizza stacked on top of each other. Unbelievable is all I could think. And who stacks pizza on top of each other? I walked back in and told them my order was still wrong.  A different employee took a slice of cheese pizza, threw some pepperoni on top, and put it in the oven. This is weird, right? Then she pulled it out of the oven and told me to have a great night in an extremely phony voice. She didn't even apologize for the poor service. When I was a teenager, I worked at Cottage Inn, a restaurant with a very large menu and variety of items. I could run the register, take orders, and make all the food by myself on a busy night. It might be hard, but I could certainly handle it on my own. This place can't even get pizza by the slice right with two attempts and three employees working. I was extremely embarrassed for them and would hate to see what it's like when they're actually busy. The pizza was mediocre.
