The worse part of the whole experience is the parking and getting to your car after the performance.  No one directing traffic, no lights and plenty of dust.  I hated that they have special parking for handicap as almost everyone using that area could clearly walk fine and after the performance these same people sped thru the parking area with no regard for those of us having to walk further to our car.  Just a bad experience. If you can park close to the exit and be fast out of your seat you have a chance. We were walking with slow pokes so we got stuck in a big mess of traffic.",

If you want quality and a variety even with Safeway brands  Safeway is great for that. They have a deli, bakery and pharmacy. They also have a Starbucks inside. The one complaint I have lately with them is their meat department. The quality of their meat isn't as great as it use to be. We've found bone grit on the pork and bones in boneless skinless chicken. Otherwise I love their produce, breads, desserts and products!! Plus you'll always get GREAT customer service and asked if you need help out!! Or you can also do self checkout instead.",

This place, the food, the beer, the ambience: everything is just epic. \n\nEspecially if you visit around Christmas when everything is lit up, just be sure you dress up with extra layers and you will totally enjoy the place. The seating is in open but if you are lucky, you might find a nice warm spot near a heater.  \n\nQUEUE: The queue for the food is ridiculously long. \n\nSEATING: Could get crowded and you might end up sharing benches with strangers. I know it sounds bad but it really wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference.\n\nPRICE: Not too much. Value for money especially considering the fact that it is a tourist place. \n\nTIP: If you are driving, be extra extra careful as the roads are treacherous in winters. A 4x4 vehicle especially with winter tyres and perhaps a set of chains in the trunk is a good idea. Also, LAYER UP LAYER UP!",
