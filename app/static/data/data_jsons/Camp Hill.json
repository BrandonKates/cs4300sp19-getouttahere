The bottom layer was soggy because the strawberries (I am guessing the were previously frozen, when thawed, the juice ran. The frosting was very good.  I appreciate their attempt to please my vegan daughter, but if you can't doing something that you know will be done very well, charging $42.70 for a 7 inch round cake is a bit much.   That was not the worse part of the experience however.  While waiting in line (and being the next person in line) walked to the register to the girl that was finishing up and told her I was there to pick up a cake.  With a very rude attitude, she said that they take person in order, and proceeded to walk off before I had the chance to tell her I was next in line.  So the some of the people could use some training in customer service.  A suggestion, have a designated person to help those picking up orders so that people do not have to wait for the 3 year old to take 20 minutes to figure out what cupcake or cookie they want!!
