There were only 2 small areas where patrons could sit and eat and stay dry.  In prior years, the festival supplied large covered tents & picnic tables which accommodated a lot more  patrons giving them some reprieve from the rain/sun.  However; I noticed  there were no shortages of tables, chairs & covered tents for patrons of the beer tent.  We go to the festival for the music and rarely go to the beer tent.  Why is the festival  catering solely to beer garden patrons and not  the other patrons of  the festival?  I think more effort should go into making more room for people to be able to sit under covered tents to eat and stay dry or out of the sun.  Bring back the covered craft tent; that worked well and relocate it  where it used to be.  This would make more room for eating areas with covered tents.  On Sunday we felt like we were walking through the trenches , so much mud, wet and sand.  It was a real safety hazard if you had to walk over to Stage 5 or 6.  Why did the crew not foresee  the hazard here and  put down a  walking platform of some kind; they were totally unprepared.  What would it have cost?  Not much -especially since the festival spent $1000 to purchase hoodies for the performers to stay warm; performers should have had their own. Please consider making changes  in these 2 areas for next year.  Festival goers deserve better and like to be able to return with improvements.", "time": 1534983001}, {"author_name": "Lujia Cai", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107294107225856144670/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eBrSAGKnrK4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAKpM/EjSC1vzhPCI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "3 months ago", "text": "really fun; volunteers are all great people; shuttle is very appreciable and convenient; view from across the city is the best", "time": 1546492130}, {"author_name": "Courtney Parker", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114202135446777955739/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7WTrKCRUMO8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACCg/41tl0DxuFs4/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "I love it every year!

Then just after we ordered dessert they informed us that we had to leave as another party was coming in. They didn't even offer for us to move to another location yet the rest of the restaurant was empty (a sunday night at 6pm.. not exactly rush hour). They told us they could pack up our desserts even though they had arrived on plates at the same moment. Not happy as we had wanted to stay and chat and have drinks longer as it was our christmas party and we had picked that time specifically so it wouldn't be busy. Also very awkward to have another party come in and us still be in their seats.. Very unprofessional and bad management to book two events so close together. Food was okay. Nothing to rave about.

My Dad had 10 fractured vertebrae and could not do a whole lot himself, and this supposed \"rehab facility\" gave us ZERO advance notice of any discharge date. So my Dad had to be discharged without occupational therapy making any home visits prior to his discharge, my Mom had to scramble to contact my Dad's cancer doctors to get prescriptions ordered to take home, we had to urgently find a medical device company to deliver a lift chair last minute since that was the only device my Dad could rest or sleep in, and on and on. Then, when I called to complain about the lack of planning, some administrator named Kelly spoke over me for several minutes, and then when I became frustrated, she HUNG UP on me!!! I called back, and she HUNG UP again!!! I've never seen such a poorly run facility, with jerks for staff members, and a complete lack of empathy.

There were only 2 small areas where patrons could sit and eat and stay dry.  In prior years, the festival supplied large covered tents & picnic tables which accommodated a lot more  patrons giving them some reprieve from the rain/sun.  However; I noticed  there were no shortages of tables, chairs & covered tents for patrons of the beer tent.  We go to the festival for the music and rarely go to the beer tent.  Why is the festival  catering solely to beer garden patrons and not  the other patrons of  the festival?  I think more effort should go into making more room for people to be able to sit under covered tents to eat and stay dry or out of the sun.  Bring back the covered craft tent; that worked well and relocate it  where it used to be.  This would make more room for eating areas with covered tents.  On Sunday we felt like we were walking through the trenches , so much mud, wet and sand.  It was a real safety hazard if you had to walk over to Stage 5 or 6.  Why did the crew not foresee  the hazard here and  put down a  walking platform of some kind; they were totally unprepared.  What would it have cost?  Not much -especially since the festival spent $1000 to purchase hoodies for the performers to stay warm; performers should have had their own. Please consider making changes  in these 2 areas for next year.
