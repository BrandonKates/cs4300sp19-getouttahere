Chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and a few berries was my favorite - rich in flavor, moderately sweet, a little crisp on the outside and deliciously liquid on the inside. \n\nService was outstanding. Our waitress was down to earth and friendly, something that is often rare in fancy restaurants where they feel they have to be stuck up to create an appropriate atmosphere. \n\nOverall, I think I would come back. It is not very friendly to a vegan or vegetarian, but their sweet potato fried are to die for, not literally...", "time": 1544623625}, {"author_name": "Chris Lawrence", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118184953714447463610/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-kFdvaWZHhlA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAR8/ldxnb7DsrrY/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "in the last week", "text": "Our server Benson did not lie to us about the quality of food. +++ Rating.
