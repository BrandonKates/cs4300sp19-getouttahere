When I asked her after the presentation about this, she confidently said that 16.8 is the correct number and asked me to check it up. She mentioned that she works there, perhaps alluding that must mean her information must be credible. I am a working scientist and extremely eager to know the source of this breakthrough, which I am not aware of. If I turn out to be right, perhaps I would say I did not like the unfortunate attitude to deny the misinformation coming from a science educator. I also missed the old charms of Calcutta skyline and diminishing moon overhead. Instead heard a cheap, restaurant-like saxophone music before the show starts. I must confess, this itself is a kind of deal-breaker for me and  I sincerely missed the old ambiance. The graphics was new and fantastic.

This place has many show timing which you can check on Google. The price of the tickets are 80/- per person. There is separate place to keep your baggage and the baggage counter is not charged. There are also toilets available for both ladies and gents. Inside the planetarium it is fully air- conditioned and it will be nice for you to grab the back seats as it is more easy to view everything from there and there is also no seat number on the tickets. So, you can take with you food and drinks, but it's my advice to carry them earlier as there is not much shops there and exorbitant charges are taken sometimes. Once the show starts, you can see that on the top of the planetarium. Good for kids as well as grown ups. Must visit the place once for a try.
