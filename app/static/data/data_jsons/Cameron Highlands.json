Here, Francis gave us plenty of interesting info on the BOH tea plantations and we then drove to the tea factory for a tour around.\n\nWe had a walk in the mossy forest for an hour or two, which was amazing. It's not the boardwalk route that you have to pay entry for, but a much more natural and much more impressive section of the forest - there was lots of climbing and crouching involved! We definitely couldn't have done this section without a guide either. After lunch we walked up the third highest peak in the region, which was pretty strenuous but rewarding. Throughout the walks Francis told us interesting stuff about the nature around us; we were dropped back off at our hostel at about 1600.\n\nI thought this was good value for a whole day (100RM) and would recommend it if you're in the Cameron Highlands!", "time": 1552122242}, {"author_name": "Jade Anastasia Cocurullo", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101557734632423039683/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z_zakIE7BN0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEc/4wMsnUsI6Wo/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 2, "relative_time_description": "a week ago", "text": "We did the half day mossy forest tour.\n\nOur tour guide was half an hour late to pick us up from our hotel which wasn\u2019t a pleasant start to the tour\n\nOur tour guide did not bring us to the mossy forest!
