I let this slide as I was with my two children (5 & 7).  I asked them to remake the order and again it was wrong.  \n\nThe photo attached shows the order as it was written (it looks pretty straight forward).  \n\nThis time it was my fault for the error again and after more snide comments from the senior person, I was informed that I'd ordered something that wasn't allowed.  At this point, I raised the fact that the menu is pretty clear and lists what I ordered.  Again, it was still felt to be my fault.  At this point I called up the snarling service and that telling me I've ordered something that isn't allowed post event is pretty annoying (i.e. tell me up front before I've paid).  \n\nWe had a 'ding dong', until the senior person apologised.\n   \nSo what have I learnt from this experience - It's right to call up people that are being rude to you, whether you're a customer or in any other circumstance (I waited until the 3rd incident).  There's also a time to walkaway, before you really lose your cool.  The order was still wrong and my children wouldn't eat the bagel as it wasn't toasted.
