At least if the staff is going to join us walking around they could be a giving an informal tour to make us feel a little at ease. It was just such an odd, uncomfortable experience.

I think the festival ran its course years ago, when Roger was still alive. Fully half of the movies are already available in the library.",

It is supposed to be a film festival, but it is a self congratulatory party with no sense of film discovery or direction.

I think the festival ran its course years ago, when Roger was still alive. Fully half of the movies are already available in the library.",

The hot bun was hard and stale and the french fries were burnt.  Our son could only eat about half of the hot dog and didn't eat any french fries.  The pizza was good and the waitress was great but management's SMALL discount on a kid's meal not eaten will keep us from going back.",

The only thing I was sorta disappointed about was the $9- 6p that I purchase. I think it was very pricey for what you recieved. Possibly through a side in there & I could justify the price. \nAs for the sauces, I'm not a fan but PLEASE don't let that stop you because I ate most of it without anything on them & it was SUPER DELICIOUS. This was my first time but definitely NOT my last. \nToo, I purchased a piece of double chocolate pie. I haven't eaten it yet but I'm sure it is as delicious as it looks. I can see why people are raving about it. \nOne word of advice- Come hungry because the portions are actually filling.",
