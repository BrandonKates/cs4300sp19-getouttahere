The film is a bit dated but still great and a must-see. Not quite as many artifacts as I was hoping to see, but the replica lockers are fun nonetheless. Gift shop prices were reasonable for high-quality merchandise. Most notably, the people at the admission desk and gift shop were friendly and very helpful (they even offered to call a cab for me!).",

The multimedia presentations provided information & clarification to the experience. The staff was friendly and informative & always willing to help. The exterior architecture was beautiful yet humbling & added to the somewhat somber experience. Get the tickets to the tower, it's worth it. The old elevator is awesome & the view is spectacular.

The aquarium has mostly saltwater fishes, with a couple of tanks of freshwater fishes towards the beginning of the experience. That said, this aquarium does a wonderful job of having family friendly interactions. I go several times a year and always have a blast for at least 2 hours a trip, though the busier days make you feel like you should go through faster. That said, take your time and enjoy all the fish!!!",

The menu does have some fried seafood options and chicken fingers for kids or adults who may not like the low country boil bag option.  They also will supply you with some gloves, apron, and wet wipes so you don't have to worry about getting too messy.  I would recommend this place for a Kansas City seafood spot however I didn't think the extra hot cajon came close to spicy.",

It's basically a guy who wanted a place where people could socialize, and \"feel at home,\" but also make money from it. Pretty good model. \n\nHe said that he's been the owner for 20+ years, but it has been around for 90ish years, so that was cool. I would say that while I get that he does want to make people feel like they are just hanging out with friends, he should still treat it as a business. There are no prices anywhere, or even menus. \n\nThere is a Mon-Sun menu up top, but this is only nostalgic, and apparently not relevant. The website Is also obsolete, and says the same thing. That was disappointing because we went for the African Chicken only to discover they didn't have that, or even chicken for that matter. The menu is basically what he feels like making that day until he runs out, so you have to walk up and ask and he'll list off a few things that he can cook. \n\nThere weren't many tasty options for those who don't eat red meat (grits or a black bean burrito was it). When we sat down he told us to \"grab a drink and feel at home.\" Which made it sound like it was complimentary. The same went for asking if we got enough, or he would bring out more. Certainly wouldn't be worth $28 for seconds, but I get it, the bills need to be paid for such a trendy place. I understand the model, but again. put prices somewhere so people will know that they are being charged $14 for the meal (regardless which you choose), and $2-3ish for the drinks. The quality would be worth $8-10 max, or cheaper. \n\nAt least update the website. He's also the only person cooking, so expect to wait or eat reheated leftovers if it's busy. There is limited seating, so if you aren't comfortable asking to sit with strangers, then you will be standing or taking out. He is a super chill guy, and there is also an older live band. He's very trusting of the honor code as well, and has a lot of valuables throughout the shop that he's collected over the years. Very cool stuff, and it's expected that the people who come here will respect that. \n\nOverall, you're going for the environment or just somewhere to hang or listen to music, but if you are looking for \"quality\" food, then you should probably go elsewhere. While it isn't bad, it also isn't spectacular or earthshattering.",

We sat at the chef's table and was an interesting view. Usually you can see the whole kitchen but its actually a room. You can hear everything which i loved but can't see everything. That's was OK though since I was there to eat. I had the crab cakes, Lobster Bisque, and the risotto. Each and everything was delicious. My boyfriend got a steak and potato...could have been cooked a little more for his taste but i liked it as it came. We all got dessert and they didn't disappoint. If you haven't been since they have remodeled I would suggest you get on it! Wonderful!",

The gravy has to be made from the drippings; so good! The homemade noodles in the soup are perfectly dense but not too firm. Best fried livers too. Great service and they always seem to send us home with enough for a couple more meals. Great business, run perfectly for a long time. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!",
