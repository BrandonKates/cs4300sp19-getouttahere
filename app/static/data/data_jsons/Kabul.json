I tried them for the first time last night and will not return. I stopped in for carryout pizza by the slice for my boyfriend and me. First of all, the layout of the restaurant is dysfunctional. The kitchen/working area is so small, I don't know how the three employees were able to move around. And that's another thing. The floor behind the counter has plastic pallets on it and the employees were walking around on the pallets. It was one of the strangest things I've ever seen in a pizza place. The cash register is on a small counter where other customers were just standing around waiting for their orders, so it was impossible to try to place my order and pay. After forcing my way to the register, I ordered two cheese and two pepperoni slices. The cashier could barely figure out how to price them. Cheese and pepperoni are the most basic thing you can order! There were two other customers waiting for their orders and the staff was clearly confused who was supposed to get what order. The employees were running around manically and acting like they could barely comprehend what was going on in the store with three customers! I also noticed there was no hand washing going on as food was being handled. No employee had a clear designated spot to work. They were all just doing whatever. Who manages like that? When I finally received my order they only gave me three slices. I repeated my order of two cheese and two pepperoni. A few minutes later I received my order in a small box and thought to myself \"how in the world are there four slices of New York style pizza in here? Did the employee stack them on top of each other?\" I was so annoyed I walked out to my car, opened the box, and guess what? Three slices of pizza stacked on top of each other. Unbelievable is all I could think. And who stacks pizza on top of each other? I walked back in and told them my order was still wrong.  A different employee took a slice of cheese pizza, threw some pepperoni on top, and put it in the oven. This is weird, right? Then she pulled it out of the oven and told me to have a great night in an extremely phony voice. She didn't even apologize for the poor service. When I was a teenager, I worked at Cottage Inn, a restaurant with a very large menu and variety of items. I could run the register, take orders, and make all the food by myself on a busy night. It might be hard, but I could certainly handle it on my own. This place can't even get pizza by the slice right with two attempts and three employees working. I was extremely embarrassed for them and would hate to see what it's like when they're actually busy. The pizza was mediocre.
