It's the people that make it such a fun experience! You can actually feel the heat from the \"fire cannons\" after the flames score. The whole stadium is spectacularly red, from the lighting to the fan jerseys. A husky will fire out jerseys during the game too! How that dog got a firearm license is beyond me. The view from all sections gives you a decent view of the game so no need to worry about visibility (they also have huge TV screens for sections farther from the rink). \n\nIntermission means a flood of people heading to the washrooms so there is 100% a line for every single washroom. They have metal detectors before you enter the dome as well and you're not allowed to bring in food/drink. \n\nFood sold there is alright, beer, mac n cheese, fries, pretzels, your typical game food. They did have vegetarian options though. There's plenty of stalls strewn around the hallways with vendors walking up the stairway to sell directly at your seat. \n\nSome issues I have are with the hallways leading to the seats + the seats themselves. The Saddledome wasn't even fully filled and there were issues with getting out after the game. There's just so little room to move around that you're squished. Also getting to your seat in the middle of a row is seriously annoying. There's very little room to walk past other people so try to get tickets on the edge of the row. My tickets were 240$ for 2 people in section 2 but that can vary.  \n\nIt's definitely aging consider Calgary's population but it does the job. Space issues and the overall look is industrial.

The atmosphere is electric with tons of people cheering and the dome erupts after every point. A save? You'll hear cheers. A point scored against Calgary? There's still applause. It's the people that make it such a fun experience! You can actually feel the heat from the \"fire cannons\" after the flames score. The whole stadium is spectacularly red, from the lighting to the fan jerseys. A husky will fire out jerseys during the game too! How that dog got a firearm license is beyond me. The view from all sections gives you a decent view of the game so no need to worry about visibility (they also have huge TV screens for sections farther from the rink). \n\nIntermission means a flood of people heading to the washrooms so there is 100% a line for every single washroom. They have metal detectors before you enter the dome as well and you're not allowed to bring in food/drink. \n\nFood sold there is alright, beer, mac n cheese, fries, pretzels, your typical game food. They did have vegetarian options though. There's plenty of stalls strewn around the hallways with vendors walking up the stairway to sell directly at your seat. \n\nSome issues I have are with the hallways leading to the seats + the seats themselves. The Saddledome wasn't even fully filled and there were issues with getting out after the game. There's just so little room to move around that you're squished. Also getting to your seat in the middle of a row is seriously annoying. There's very little room to walk past other people so try to get tickets on the edge of the row. My tickets were 240$ for 2 people in section 2 but that can vary.  \n\nIt's definitely aging consider Calgary's population but it does the job. Space issues and the overall look is industrial. That said, you'll have a great time despite these small issues. It's a must go and the facility itself shouldn't stop you from relaxing and having a blast at the Saddledome!
