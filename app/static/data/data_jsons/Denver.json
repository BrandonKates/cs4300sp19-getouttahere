They have interesting classes for children that take place in the basement, and the activities combine art-making with historical or cultural lessons.\n\nIt's not just a museum for children, however; often the exhibits are challenging and provocative (as art should be). The current exhibit is \"Espacio Liminal/Liminal Space.\" A multi-artist show curated by artist Frank Lucero, it includes paintings as well as multimedia pieces and sculptures, a variety of abstract and realistic (if heightened) artwork, and an interactive installation, too. Certainly these pieces could make a powerful impression upon a young viewer, but the ways liminality are expressed both in Latino culture and in these works of art will be noticed best by adults.\n\nMuseo de las Americas is a small museum, but foot by foot, it is perhaps the most innovative and exciting museum in Denver.
