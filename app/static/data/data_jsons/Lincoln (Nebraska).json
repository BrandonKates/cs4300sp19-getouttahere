I thought I would just be going there and like raking leaves for a day and nothing else. Little did I know that it would be one of the greatest things I have ever done in my life. I was able to basically be an employee at the zoo. I got to show people the animals and Information about them. We would hold the horses while kids would ride them, we would give water tattoos to little kids and let them pet chinchillas. We got to spray kids hands with sugar water to that butterflies would land on their hands. It taught me to respect animals and how to work with other people. This zoo has such an amazing variation of animals and they take care of them so well.
