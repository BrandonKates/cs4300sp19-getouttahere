All visits are guided, but $5 for students and kids and $7 for adults, and around a 1.5 hour tour it seems like a very reasonable charge. Better yet, it seems that most visitors go with a personal tour guide not in a group. This is a good way to spend a couple hours, and I would recommend at least doing it once just to check it out.",

I stopped in about a half hour before close.  They had been extremely busy due to the public's support for the officer so they had run out of pizza, which is a good problem to have.   Unfortunately I had already paid for my pizza, they offered to exchange my pizza for sandwiches and wings, but I was craving delicious pizza.  I suggested getting a pizza tomorrow and they immediately agreed to that arrangement.  So tonight, I went in and had a nice conversation with one of the team members about our mutual love of Darth Vader, got my pizza and I could not be happier.",

Just FYI they\u2019re going through a name change, they used to be CrossFit Outlook, which is still up as their sign on the building, but Google has this correctly as CrossFit Jolly Roger. Anyway they\u2019re on the backside of a building. Tim, Becky, and Billie Sue are all very knowledgeable and super committed to safety and proper form. Anytime I asked for a clarification they already respond with not only proper technique but the underlying reasons behind it, which is most helpful for someone like me who wants to understand the what and the why. I believe they\u2019re fairly new as a gym but that can be a very good thing. 1) You can be part of a growing community. 2) Small class sizes = more tailored coaching. 3) Individualized instruction can translate to better form, which in turn translates to quicker growth and a safer CrossFitter!",

Each one brings a different style and are diligent in watching athletes to ensure proper form, which is super important to me. I don't feel like a number or means to an end.

Service has been poor, food has been poor and the place has looked dingy and not so clean. However, I like to support local businesses and I went 1/29/2018 for lunch.  It was the best experience I've had in ages.  I was seated promptly.  The new GM came to with parm and olive oil and to take my drink order.  My drink order was brought promptly by my server along with a loaf of bread for dipping.  I placed my order.  Food arrived promptly and was tastier than I have received in ages at Rocky's.  As I dined I watched the GM and servers clean tables.  Every item was removed, not just pushed around and tables were given a cleaning.  Everyone was cheerful and I felt as if they were indeed glad to have me their.  Keep up the improvement!!",
