When you pull the flower out of the vase, someone is always at the table to help in a timely manner.   If the flower is not out of the vase, we are not constantly interrupted by a server.  It is a great place to go and kill a few hours without feeling rushed.  The atmosphere is very cozy and well decorated.  ",

I've enjoyed their breakfasts, burgers, American chop suey and several other faves... all good!\nThe pricing is very reasonable for the portions.

Yummy desserts round out the experience. \nPretty conveniently located on Brown Ave just off Rte 293 with ample free parking. The",
