We like the variety of cacti and trees they had to offer some of the cacti were surprisingly very tall. I liked that they offered seats around the garden that you could sit back and relax at.

I dined here once and thought, \"well anyone can have an off night\", so I dined here again the next night and the experience on the front side improved, but the food was, to put it tactfully and gently, awful! They can't seem to put together a consistent service or kitchen staff. The food on my first time here this year (I have been here three times in the last year) was bland, poorly prepared, and the service was marked by an apparent lack of training and experience. Now, I realize this is Atlanta and not New York, and that good, professional help is scarce, but c'mon folks--this is supposed to be a high end place (the prices sure trend that way!). Have you ever heard of training and supervision of staff? You can do lots, lots better! When a customer shows up at the entrance with no one around, is noticed by several staff including the bartender, but still no one comes, that is a sign that the management of this restaurant either is unmotivated or clueless. Either way, much improvement is needed. Nonetheless, because I know and respect Chef Vongerichten's restaurants, and I was staying in the hotel, I decided to give it another shot. This time, I was greeted promptly, and the waitress who served me appeared professional, in addition to friendly. However, this time, the food was, to put it tactfully and diplomatically,  absolutely awful. Other than the appetizers and main course arriving together, which was something that should never happen--even in a restaurant that says it serves \"family style\" (by which I understand that the dishes are served to the table, not each individual diner), the food was simply bad. I had the chicken satay which was like eating pieces of rubber. I ate it because I was hungry, not having eaten since that morning. I had ordered sticky coconut rice wrapped in a banana leaf as a side, along with grilled halibut. Well, the sticky rice was so sticky I had to cut it with a knife to get a mouthful. The halibut was so overdone and dry that it, too, was inedible. I asked the waitress who was in the kitchen and she said the head chef (omigod! if this is what the top guy allows out his kitchen door to customers then this restaurant is in big, big trouble!). I communicated my issues to her and in a minute or so the manager appeared. I reviewed the problems with him and he was apologetic, but it remains to be seen whether this restaurant will ever rise much above the level (or to the level given, its current starting point) of Bonefish Grill or Cheesecake Factory, while charging prices far above those establishments. Thankfully, I did not have to pay for this meal, but I would have gladly paid for a meal that even came close to expectations of a restaurant in this restaurant group.\nOne last thing-I hate writing bad reviews. A bad review means that I had a bad experience in a place and at a time when the experience should be nothing but pleasant. Anyone who reads my reviews on TripAdvisor knows that I tend to be glowing in my praise when a restaurant provides a good experience. I want to appreciate, and can, any type of dining experience. I don't expect the local pit barbecue to be Per se, but I do expect any restaurant running under the banner of a fabulous chef like Jean Georges Vongerichten to be at least adequate. So, to write a review like this is both unusual and dismaying for me. I do hope, if I am at Spice Market Atlanta next year, that I will be able to retract this review and report a wonderful experience from service to food. I hope so.", "time": 1393720115}, {"author_name": "Anthony Trosclair", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115412055521979573686/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-n5HyXupERdM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAVE/gNLDmPhvF9Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "9 years ago", "text": "trendy, hip, great food and service to matchy. when dining in the heart of midtown, who could ask for anything more.", "time": 1257465600}, {"author_name": "John Williamson", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108696717208603506192/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-JSovJXi_e3s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA9s/rZu-So4SLTE/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "8 years ago", "text": "small plates, over-priced, ok food", "time": 1293840000}]}, "status": "OK"}, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Village Seafood Buffet": {"type": "eat", "description": ["buffet", "one", "better", "buffets", "las", "vegas", "extensive", "seafood", "collection", "well", "items", "lines", "long", "note", "rio", "also", "offers", "carnivale", "world", "buffet", "cheaper", "offer", "total", "seafood", "oriented", "buffet", "features", "changing", "variety", "dishes", "featuring", "seafood", "tables", "close", "together", "noisy"], "coordinates": [36.1172, -115.1885], "website": "http://www.riolasvegas.com/restaurants/village-seafood-buffet.html", "place_id": "ChIJVVVVVZHGyIARZ_76CdOJGCY", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "The Buffet": {"type": "eat", "description": ["arguably", "best", "buffet", "strip", "dinner", "menu", "including", "pre", "split", "crab", "legs", "venison", "kobe", "beef", "wild", "boar", "gourmet", "friday", "dinner", "includes", "beef", "wellington", "rack", "lamb", "veal", "ossobuco", "grilled", "swordfish", "curried", "duck", "legs", "buffet", "spectacular", "selections", "italy", "china", "japan", "well", "fresh", "seafood", "traditional", "american", "food", "wait", "enter", "90", "minutes"], "coordinates": [36.1134, -115.1765], "website": "http://www.bellagio.com/restaurants/the-buffet.aspx", "place_id": "ChIJS0B4ZMzCyIARhffosGsUFJk", "reviews": {"html_attributions": [], "result": {"price_level": 3, "rating": 4.3, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Melanie Vineyard", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114265619669858534174/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8wn0nVBbEGo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHc4/DfZSvFJhgI0/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "2 weeks ago", "text": "The food was delicious and our server, Jeremy was so nice.
