In addition, when the food arrived (which I'm not sure if this is  normal)  it stood on trays for about 10 minutes while our server disappeared.   \n\nThen other servers would come look at the food, then the order notepad,  and I'm guessing they couldn't figure out who's was who's.   I get it, they don't want to go around asking who had what...  because it's a fancy place.  But the food sat there for a good while.  \n\nAnyway, maybe it just wasn't that servers night.
