Perhaps had we got here an hour before closing, our experience would have been more pleasant.\nWe were repeatedly told they were closing in x minutes, although I would look at the phone and see that they were just rushing us. This happened with every employee we encountered. \n\nThe two guards at the O'Keeffe exhibit made us most uncomfortable. They lurked behind us and gave us warnings every three minutes that the museum was closing. We expressed that we were just there to see the O'Keeffe paintings, but that did not deter them. They made it awkward when my 9 year old wanted to take pictures with her favorite artist's paintings. I got the feeling they didnt appreciate a child being there. We went to go back to the O'Keeffe paintings, only to be told where the exit was.\n\nI informed the gentleman that we just wanted to get one last look. He permitted us to do this. As we left, I noted that it was 4:53 and thanked him for their hospitality. He suggested we return when they weren't closing. I told him we traveled a long way to get there.\n\nIn the gift shop, they are closing in 5 minutes. At least this was near accurate. Credit cards only now. No problem. Another reminder of what time they closed and we left without buying anything. The previous day we had spent over $100 in gift shops. Not here.\n\nOn the way out, I stepped to the side to see the exquisite gardens only to be informed that this was not the way out. \n\nGet out. We got the message. It was 5:00 and  we were getting into our car in the garage. Three minutes later, they shut the main gate. Great. \ud83d\ude44\n\nWith regards to the exhibit itself, there were two O'Keeffe pieces. It was quiet and not very welcoming, but with a nice selection and variation of pieces.\n\nWe were super excited to see this museum. Happy it was free. \n\nNOT family friendly. The only place we visited that was rude in this area. We joked how we had just said how nice and polite people in Ohio are and then the Taft museum proved us wrong.
