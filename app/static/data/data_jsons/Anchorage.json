We came in uniform, which I try to avoid but couldn't that day. We we re thanks for our service by patrons and staff. Not that I ever expect that because I don't. It was just a very nice thing to have happened. The entire experience was so stereotypical TV show friendly diner. It was awesome! We'll be back!\n\nDid I mention I got the veggie omelet and my veggies we're actually cooked AND crispy?!?",

I went to dinner around six in the evening, on a high school prom night that I wasn't aware of, and was told that there would be around s 45 minute wait.  I was seated in less than 15.  I ordered the blackened halibut with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The food was deliscious though the portions were rather small.  Not so with the dessert.  I had their famous bread pudding and it was really good.  Prices range from around $12-$40.  I had an ice tea with my meal and it came to a little over $50.  All in all, a very nice dining experience and I would definitely go there again.",

The Anchorage nachos are a must try and would recommend. I did like the halibut and the coconut and raspberry beer. Was not a fan of the jalapeno cornbread the syrup makes it taste burnt in the cast iron skillet, maybe because it was cooked way to long. Had a bite of the shrimp and grits a little spicy packed with a lot of heat was a little much on the heat side but was good.But for a place that seems like there is not a lot of good eating this would be one place I would stop again when I come back to when I fly through. Folks here are pretty nice.",

Now about the food. It was very good, and you won't go home hungry. Their pancakes are larger than the plate. There is a great selection of foods. Note: They are only open for breakfast and lunch.

That said, they have waiting buzzer things now, so it's not as bad to hang around for your table.  The omelettes and soups and salads are phenomenal.  They have a hot sauce bar too, which ... is just nice to have.  Staff are always friendly and the vibe is comfortable at any time of year!  Very kid-friendly too.",

Waitress (can\u2019t recall her name, I think it was Jeannine) was knowledgeable, funny, and personal. My husband had the special, it was halibut, which was tasty but very small portioning. My plate had large portions so I guess it depends on what you order. Overall the experience was great!",
