My husband, my brother-in-law, and I will never forget the hospitality of the staff and of course the amazing meal that we shared that night. That is why months later it is still a main topic of discussion. The night sort of started on a whim after I remembered the show and how much I wanted to try this artichoke dish. A few days after Thanksgiving the largest winter storm last year up to that point hit right as we arrived at The Edwin and we found ourselves stuck. That is  a poor choice of words because the word \"stuck\" itself suggest that you are in a place you would prefer not to be. That could not have been further from the truth. All of the staff from top to bottom along with their delicious cuisine took all of our minds off of the pending procedure my father in law was having done the follow morning. We could not be more grateful.
