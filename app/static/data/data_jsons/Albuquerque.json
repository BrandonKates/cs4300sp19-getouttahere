I find great deals on organic produce like bagged organic apples and potatoes when I'm there. Sometimes they're a bit bruised but I use them for juicing and for the price that is acceptable. Basically they just buy up unsaleable lots from other health food stores and resell them. Kind of an outlet mall for natural foods. One thing I disapprove of.. is there's an obnoxiously large liquor department taking up half the store. And everything being packaged does add an element of wastefulness, it would be nice to see a bulk bins section. The cashiers are above and beyond friendly and helpful though and the atmosphere and location of the store are both ideal.
