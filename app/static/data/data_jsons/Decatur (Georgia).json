The venue is well-suited to hold a ceremony, reception, cocktail hour, caterers, photography, or anything else you might need. They're prepared and easy to work with. Not to mention the location - the courthouse is surrounded by hotels, transportation, and restaurants, which makes the visit easy for your guests. I have NO regrets about choosing the courthouse, and would do it again in a heartbeat.",

This means find some better parking then the overpriced parking lot next to it. Then there's the food. The options in the menu are almost limitless. However, they are not so flavorful. The international varieties of burritos are ultimately flavorless. It taste like water with a hint of vegetables. The only thing worth eating there was the chips and salsa. They claim to travel the world on order to make great burritos but the flavor is anything but great.",

Our waitress was impeccable - professional, friendly, knew the menu, made helpful suggestions and made sure we always had plenty of water. \n\nThe Burger Stack was priced at $14 but worth every penny. A simple burger with cheese and pickles and a delicious bun. What made it perfect was the excellent service if the meat and the tender, juicy patty. It was one of the best I've had. The fries were perfectly fried, crispy with a touch of salt.\n\nWe ordered three desserts - seasonal cheesecake, rice pudding and Brooklyn blackout cake. All three were fantastic, but my family's favorites were the seasonal cheesecake and the rice pudding.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and relaxed. They played great music, that didn't overwhelm our conversation but was a nice addition to the environment. It's more of a cafe style, so not a formal dining experience but perfect for a casual date or family outing when you want quality food in a nice place.",

The food is fantastic on an ever rotating menu full of seasonal offerings. They also have a variety of craft beer available and yes whiskey. Reminds me of a true Irish pub.\n\nThey have a great little patio are that is perfect for having a couple of cocktails or especially nice to enjoy brunch. Order the Chinese breakfast complete with crispy pork belly. \n\nA secret tip... order the house burger (it\u2019s off menu) complete with bacon, fresh jalape\u00f1os and pimento cheese. Oh Yeah! \n\nAnd, if you\u2019re in the neighborhood... they throw one hell of a good party on St. Paddy\u2019s day; live music, drink specials and give aways.\n\nPlus Code- QM5W+PG Decatur, Georgia",

I sadly, however, cannot give 5 stars. We ordered two small dishes to share because we intended to have dinner a couple hours later. The server accidentally put in the order incorrectly. He explained this, and offered us the dish in his hand while we waited for the initial order. As a server, I understood he offered this because he can\u2019t return it to the kitchen anymore, and that it would be thrown away. We said, \u201csure!\u201d and shared it as a group.

I think he or she should find another owner or a partner and open up his or her own restaurant.  I will be surprised if people still would come to this restaurant in that case. Let me tell you this, who would charge 15% gratuity for two adults and three kids younger than nine years for total number of items less than three. The service is awful. We ordered IPG mule with the request to the server to make it a little stronger.  When we received the bill it was charged twice the price. Even in Chicago downtown, I did not pay for $22 a mule. Responsible server should have made this clear upon receipt of an order. It is of no surprise that the restaurant cannot provide a professional service to their patrons.  If not for the company. I would not have come to this restaurant again. But as I said before, chef does a wonderful job keeping up with the taste for Indian Chinese food, guess what, I will be ordering for carry out next time. I hate to write a negative review but this has happened three times consecutively to me with my American and Indian friends and every time, I am disappointed by the restaurant management. I do not disagree with the previous negative reviews of this restaurant. I wish them good luck  and I hope that it retains chefs.  Without them, this place is nothing but bamboo and a fireplace connecting another Indian restaurant.",

We order tom-yum soup, chili chicken, Singapore rice and chicken 65 fried rice. We found hair in our soup. Besides, the other dishes were tasteless and the service was extremely poor. The waiter did not even apologize and just waved off the bill only for the soup. I did not say anything to him, but wanted to highlight that situation to everybody. I strongly recommend not to visit Bamboo Garden, ironically, specialized in Pan Asian Chinese Cuisine. Do not waste your money.",
