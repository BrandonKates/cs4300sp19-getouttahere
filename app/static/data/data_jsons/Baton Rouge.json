Located at 100 North Boulevard in Baton Rouge, it was built to both look like and function like a castle. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974. Today, it is a museum. Restored in the 1990s, the Old State Capitol is now the Museum of Political History, within walking distance of the current capitol tower and many culturally significant buildings in downtown Baton Rouge, including the Old Louisiana Governor's Mansion, the Louisiana Arts and Science Museum, St. Joseph Cathedral and the Shaw Center. The Museum of Political History features attractions and exhibits showcasing the building as an architectural treasure and highlighting historic artifacts.

The young girl there says she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable giving me her bosses name then proceeds to tell me how we ignored them when they told us to start the trail and be at our car by 5.

I was craving for some soul/southern food and this place does not disappoint.  The menu was varied with different meals such as poor boys and select fresh seafood.  I ended up with the Red Beans and Rice platter with sausage added to it for an extra $2.  The plate came with mustard greens, mashed sweet potato, and corn bread.  With sweet tea to drink my meal came to about $14.  Well worth the price.  The atmosphere was very relaxed and it felt like I was at home.

The crust was not like the other locations. It was hard. My son got the pretzel bites the only good thing that came to our table. It's what I expected my crust on my pizza to be. Our waitress forgot about us once it got busy. The host was the only reason this place got 2 stars. She was amazing and so friendly with my son. I think it needs to meet the management at other locations. Next time we will wait till I visit my in laws in Georgia. Such a huge let down.
