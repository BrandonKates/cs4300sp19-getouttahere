Over a half hour goes by and out comes my steak..... no salad... no big deal just asked them to forget the salad(appetizer) when I cut into the steak which was ordered medium it was medium well, almost well done.\nSo long story short, I know as a server you hate single diners but we eat too and a little secret we usually tip quite well.

This is the second time it has happened where they have like twelve empty tables but they refuse to sit people because their kitchen is backed up or whatever. I mean seriously? Let's have people stand up and not even get drinks because our back of the house is poorly run? If they weren't the only place in Lookout Valley they'd be closed. The managers need to go work in another industry because they don't understand service.\n\nThen it gets worse. We're finally seated, and we're seated as far away from TV's as possible. We ask can't we just sit at one of those other 12-15 empty tables closer to a TV. The hostess says she will check, then she comes back and says no. What is going on with this place?\n\nIn the end I decided they weren't worth my money and we just ordered drinks until the game was finished and went and ate somewhere else. That is how bad the customer service was here, I decided I would rather drive somewhere else to eat just to deprive them of revenue I felt they didn't deserve.",

Could have been excellent,  but from the lack luster greeting at the door it should have been a sign that things are not managed well. I sat facing the \"to go\" counter and felt deeply sorry for the folks thinking they were going to grab and go. There was an average wait time of 25 minutes.  Saw people dress like managers but we were never approached or greeted by one.",
