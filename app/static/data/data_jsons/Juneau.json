Those two things being said, as a local, I love the tram. The views are stellar and it's a wonderful experience to see Juneau from new heights without hiking up a mountain on one's own to do so.\n\nMost of the tramway \ud83d\udea1 operators are knowledgeable, out-going, and enjoy what they do. I have yet to meet an employee working the tram that I didn't like! Be aware that the tram, as it's being docked at the top, does slow down and rock gently back and forth prior to it lodging firmly into place for your safe exit on the top of Mount Roberts. If you have a fear of heights, the rocking motion may make you uneasy; and, it's important to note, the tram does have you riding above treetops. If afraid of heights, look out and not down! The lift takes about 5 minutes to go up and 5 minutes to go back down and is made available for either direction within reasonably spaced, short intervals. Once off-loaded, at the top of Mount Roberts, take your time to enjoy the Nature Center, the Gift Shop, Grab a Bite to Eat, and find your way to Father Brown's Cross for Amazing, Awe-inspiring Views that seem like movie back-drops but are perfectly real; a place where time stands still. \n\nWhat goes up, must come down; thankfully, a tram like the one in Juneau is safe, secure, and smooth. It seems to glide as it brings you back down to earth. It's a brilliant contraption that's well maintained and kept clean. If a tourist, the expensive, round-trip ticket is worth the cost for a once in a lifetime experience like none other. If a local, the season pass would be a good thing to nab as it'll save you money and allow you to travel, by tram, as often as you'd like. \ud83d\ude0a", "time": 1532586827}, {"author_name": "Patricia Dodd", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116954982302065279547/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uFS7eVrcKhs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3red03JJAMonhvo921913sR0n5DVyg/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "What a great place!
