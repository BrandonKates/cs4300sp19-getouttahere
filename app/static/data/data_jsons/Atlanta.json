The place has been renovated within the last year (at the time of writing this) and the main tasting room is very different than the old one.

Even on the busiest nights, there aren't many places to sit, just a bunch of open standing room. This is a small quarrel with an otherwise outstanding brewery experience. I highly recommend trying the G13 420 Strain. It's currently the best beer they serve. If the hemp flavor is not really your thing, then the classic 420 Pale Ale is also a great choice. Bringing a larger group is also a good idea, as there is room for indoor cornhole which is always a good time. Overall, the beer is great and the people are very welcoming. SweetWater is always a fantastic start to the weekend.", "time": 1548874789}]}, "status": "OK"}, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Swan Coach House": {"type": "do", "description": ["historical", "house", "restaurant", "gift", "shop", "art", "gallery"], "coordinates": [33.84, 84.3861], "website": "http://www.swancoachhouse.com/", "place_id": "ChIJsRMmj4UF9YgR0xKgQCWArBY", "reviews": null, "purpose": ["friends", "educational"], "cost": ""}, "The Buckhead Theatre": {"type": "do", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [33.8404, 84.3799], "website": "http://www.thebuckheadtheatre.com/index.php/", "place_id": "ChIJZ6wEFowF9YgRgtnWhjolCJ8", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Bobby Jones Golf Course": {"type": "do", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.bobbyjonesgc.com/home", "place_id": "ChIJEatYPA8F9YgR6peaSdXkI1I", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Kuhlman": {"type": "buy", "description": ["ste", "1106", "men", "women", "shirts"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.kuhlmancompany.com/", "place_id": "ChIJH937xLAO9YgRXshXxyw1l_o", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Phipps Plaza Mall": {"type": "buy", "description": ["anchored", "saks", "fifth", "avenue", "nordstrom", "belk", "upscale", "mall", "higher", "end", "chain", "stores", "barney", "co", "op", "intermix", "versace", "armani", "gucci", "jimmy", "choo", "tiffany", "including", "jeffrey", "store", "outside", "new", "york", "well", "amc", "movie", "theater"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.simon.com/mall/default.aspx?ID=210 {{dead link|April 2016}}", "place_id": "ChIJW9BrxVAP9YgRqTaMGcXMdko", "reviews": null, "purpose": ["friends"], "cost": "high"}, "Anis Cafe and Bistro": {"type": "eat", "description": ["extremely", "romantic", "charming", "authentically", "french", "bistro", "cafe", "tucked", "away", "old", "house", "near", "pharr", "road"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.anisbistro.com/", "place_id": "ChIJ3_pPnpIF9YgR8ldYiy0rel4", "reviews": null, "purpose": ["educational", "romance"], "cost": ""}, "Buckhead Diner": {"type": "eat", "description": ["popular", "faux", "diner", "black", "tie", "waiters", "serving", "heaping", "portions", "greasy", "upscale", "diner", "food"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "https://www.buckheadrestaurants.com/buckhead-diner/", "place_id": "ChIJ_yOhbPEF9YgRwO-rJLLgAXE", "reviews": {"html_attributions": [], "result": {"price_level": 2, "rating": 4.2, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Rebecca Hamer", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110920422038599970918/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3n6hMcdcMNM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABk/YDmuhA1Gn4Q/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "in the last week", "text": "This is what you should call a \"finer diner\".

I dined here once and thought, \"well anyone can have an off night\", so I dined here again the next night and the experience on the front side improved, but the food was, to put it tactfully and gently, awful! They can't seem to put together a consistent service or kitchen staff. The food on my first time here this year (I have been here three times in the last year) was bland, poorly prepared, and the service was marked by an apparent lack of training and experience. Now, I realize this is Atlanta and not New York, and that good, professional help is scarce, but c'mon folks--this is supposed to be a high end place (the prices sure trend that way!). Have you ever heard of training and supervision of staff? You can do lots, lots better! When a customer shows up at the entrance with no one around, is noticed by several staff including the bartender, but still no one comes, that is a sign that the management of this restaurant either is unmotivated or clueless. Either way, much improvement is needed. Nonetheless, because I know and respect Chef Vongerichten's restaurants, and I was staying in the hotel, I decided to give it another shot. This time, I was greeted promptly, and the waitress who served me appeared professional, in addition to friendly. However, this time, the food was, to put it tactfully and diplomatically,  absolutely awful. Other than the appetizers and main course arriving together, which was something that should never happen--even in a restaurant that says it serves \"family style\" (by which I understand that the dishes are served to the table, not each individual diner), the food was simply bad. I had the chicken satay which was like eating pieces of rubber. I ate it because I was hungry, not having eaten since that morning. I had ordered sticky coconut rice wrapped in a banana leaf as a side, along with grilled halibut. Well, the sticky rice was so sticky I had to cut it with a knife to get a mouthful. The halibut was so overdone and dry that it, too, was inedible. I asked the waitress who was in the kitchen and she said the head chef (omigod! if this is what the top guy allows out his kitchen door to customers then this restaurant is in big, big trouble!). I communicated my issues to her and in a minute or so the manager appeared. I reviewed the problems with him and he was apologetic, but it remains to be seen whether this restaurant will ever rise much above the level (or to the level given, its current starting point) of Bonefish Grill or Cheesecake Factory, while charging prices far above those establishments. Thankfully, I did not have to pay for this meal, but I would have gladly paid for a meal that even came close to expectations of a restaurant in this restaurant group.\nOne last thing-I hate writing bad reviews. A bad review means that I had a bad experience in a place and at a time when the experience should be nothing but pleasant. Anyone who reads my reviews on TripAdvisor knows that I tend to be glowing in my praise when a restaurant provides a good experience. I want to appreciate, and can, any type of dining experience. I don't expect the local pit barbecue to be Per se, but I do expect any restaurant running under the banner of a fabulous chef like Jean Georges Vongerichten to be at least adequate. So, to write a review like this is both unusual and dismaying for me. I do hope, if I am at Spice Market Atlanta next year, that I will be able to retract this review and report a wonderful experience from service to food.

The service was impeccable. The food was perfectly portioned and prepared. I had a hard time choosing what to order because everything on the menu, within each course, sounded so good.

The location is great and avoids local road traffic in the area. I also really appreciated the self-parking. The dining room wasn't too loud and had a neat feeling, but there were a few quirks (e.g. the tables that lock you in to the bench seats and lights dimmed every time the bar dishwasher turned on). All the food was very tasty, but didn't quite blow our minds the way I would expect for a $250+ dinner. The only true disappointment was the beer list. I ordered the best IPA on tap (Wicked Weed Freak of Nature), but was informed it had already tapped out...at 6:15pm. There wasn't anything else comparable to replace it.  I wish restaurants (especially at this level) would update their beer list to reflect what is actually available.\n\nThe service was top-notch, but lacked warmth. We had everything we needed (and never thought about water), but there was no personal connection. Maybe that's their operating model?\n\nOverall, we felt like One Midtown Kitchen (now closed) and Local Three offer more creative/impressive dishes and friendlier service at a better price point compared to Bacchanalia.", "time": 1550201599}, {"author_name": "Ignacio Rossani", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117364941962837515617/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-w1TMFZiWVgs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/kgPJk2jiswA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "Absolutely amazing restaurant!
