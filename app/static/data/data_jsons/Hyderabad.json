We reached there by 1:45 and by 2:15 we realized that those reviews are well framed paid or fake reviews. We went there with Groupon coupons. Coming to the menu...\n\nSoup: some veg soup (I don't even remember the name), chicken soup (sliced boiled chicken in the same veg soup)\n\nStarters: They served us Aloo 65, Veg Pakoda (They call it crispy veg!), Chicken Manchuria and Chilli Chicken. First serving (5-6 pcs) was boneless. When we asked for the 2nd serving (4 to 5 pcs), almost every piece has a bone.  When we asked for the 3rd serving, the server gave a weird look (trust me, you don't even feel like asking for the 4th serving after that powerful weird look.)\n\nSalads: Sliced onions, carrots and keera (They call them veg salads!) Onions with curd (This must be a economical replacement to aloo with cream salad that's usually served in most of the buffets). Lots of sliced tomato with little chicken in it (They call it chicken salad!)\n\nMain course: Egg masala and fish curry with bones. Chicken biryani, raita (a mixture of 3/4 water and 1/4th curd with sliced green chillies and onion), michi ka salan. Noodles, White rice, dal, sambar, veg fry, curd, papad and pickels.\n\nDesserts: Semiya payasam, cut fruits(papaya and water melon), vanila ice cream.\n\nHighlights: For the first time in the history of mankind, I saw a hotel (that too a hotel located n prime location like somajiguda) without minimum required cutlery. They don't have a scoop for serving ice cream. We have to use a spoon for that. They don't even have dessert bowls. We have to use disposable plastic cups and spoons for that. And the most interesting part is, we have to use long handled spoons for serving rice, biryani and even sambar!! All those spoons matches the size of the spoon we use to eat the food. So if you know that you are going to eat 5 spoons, you can just serve 5 spoons and thus reduce food wastage. What an !dea sir ji... If you want to eat roti, you have to eat with egg masala coz fish curry is with bones and you never know what fish they have used (one chicken curry is the minimum expectation to have with roti). Groupon says 2 deserts and we though once should be at least gulab jamun. But we were shocked to see semiya payasam and cut fruits.\n\nConclusion: I have been to Silk Route (Banjara hills), Best Western Ashoka (Lakdikapul), 36 Dakshin (Madhapur), Celebrations (Jubilee Hills), Ebony (Banjara hills), 45 Jubilee Hills etc., which are in the same price range and they are good in at least one dish they make. So I never bothered to write a review. But now, after experiencing Hop at Terrace bay, I feel like sharing my experience so that I can save few people from falling into their reviews trap. To conclude, This is the WORST buffet I ever had and they ruined my B'day party. :( :( :(", "time": 1423021028}, {"author_name": "Satya Narayana", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117579902205123610154/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pt-P1bMgs3g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAH4/6JC2_i1ACOI/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "6 years ago", "text": "Excellent food and ambience. friendly staff\n\n", "time": 1357656012}]}, "status": "OK"}, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Tex Mex": {"type": "eat", "description": ["indian", "world", "cuisine"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJWfkf9S-XyzsRbPg5AgpvFbk", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Tulips - The Coffee Shop": {"type": "eat", "description": ["famous", "midnight", "biryani", "buffet"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJ549blbeQyzsR2WOoD_qXXTI", "reviews": {"html_attributions": [], "result": {"price_level": 2, "rating": 4.2, "reviews": [{"author_name": "R Venugopal", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114913318823384400201/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1ELs1L7hb-g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc4iVp_qva7FT3xFcL2NC3Sve5iEQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Centrally situated at Ammerpet this High quality Four Star hotel with well furnished rooms and services.
