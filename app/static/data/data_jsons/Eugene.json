I've been struggling as a transfer student to adjust to a quarter-based 10-week system. I'm used to a 15-week semester-based system. I've had a hard time learning these time constraints and ran into issues withdrawing from a couple of classes this term. Not only do they have a withdrawal deadline (for what? That is different than my past institutions) but if you want to drop a class past that deadline you're out of luck, even if it means failing it! Yep, even if it's your first ever withdrawal, they won't let you do it. For a class YOU PAID FOR! \n\nNot only that, but the man \"helping\" me at the registrar talked down to me IN PUBLIC IN THE OPEN OFFICE IN FRONT OF OTHER STUDENTS! He berated me for \"waiting too long,\" even though I've had to work 40+ hour weeks and have tried contacting professors to no avail. \n\nThis hasn't been my first issue and I'm sure it's not my last with UO.  If you're looking for a university that offers you options, look elsewhere. UO will shut you down at your first attempt.
