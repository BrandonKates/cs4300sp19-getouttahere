We shared a range of plates coupled with some local NZ project pilsners and each of them was absolutely delicious. If I had to nominate, the Sticky Beef Wontons, Fried Rice Balls and the Pumpkin Curry were the standouts at the table but seriously there was not a bad dish delivered. The atmosphere is fantastic and the staff all incredibly friendly. Well worth the visit when next you\u2019re in Christchurch.",
