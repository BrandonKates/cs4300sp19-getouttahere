So, clearly booking wasn't required and they weren't fully booked. Moreover, we were there at 18.30 when the restaurant was nearly empty.\n\nAnyway, in an attempt to avoid confrontation, I took my family back to the car and checked the website - nothing about not letting children in. So, I went back in to ask where on the website it said that children aren't allowed at which point the guy got agitated, angry and started yelling. He did not offer an explanation and kept shouting at me to go out. I asked the lying waitress directly if they are fully booked and she then knew I was onto her and she then did not repeat that they were fully booked. \n\nAbsolutely disgusting and vile behaviour from staff!\n\nI have recorded the event if anyone wants to see it please get in touch.", "time": 1553274858}]}, "status": "OK"}, "purpose": ["friends", "educational"], "cost": ""}, "Zorbaz": {"type": "eat", "description": ["best", "greek", "restaurant", "city", "prices", "reflect", "visit", "right", "time", "might", "hear", "musician", "playing", "greek", "songs", "waiters", "treating", "greek", "dancing"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.zorbas.co.uk/", "place_id": "ChIJhcu1NZlLd0gRNCGfr-_pGWU", "reviews": null, "purpose": ["friends", "family"], "cost": ""}, "Habibi": {"type": "eat", "description": ["better", "lebanese", "food", "found", "coventry", "atmosphere", "staff", "equally", "inviting", "one", "downside", "service", "bit", "slow", "side"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://sanmarcos.co.uk/ {{dead link|May 2016}}", "place_id": "ChIJ1410q8dLd0gR2Tioe-ntRL4", "reviews": {"html_attributions": [], "result": {"rating": 4.3, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Swati Mahapatra", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118234669747369446741/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xskDGFslx9w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGAE/qSH8qOtZ5-I/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg", "rating": 4, "relative_time_description": "a month ago", "text": "A good place to be in for a lousy evening.
