I recently had Scuba Sam, which is a bigger version of Scuba Steve...weighing in at 10.2%. While that is admittedly high, you would never guess it was 10.2 because it was ridiculously easy to drink; tread lightly if you choose Scuba Sam. Secondly...the food. WOW! I mean, seriously, they have a really unique and varied menu with truly something for everyone. I had the sliders and I simply could not get enough. (But one does need to stop at some point...\ud83d\ude06.) To top it off, they do have a full bar; so if beer is not your thing, you'll definitely find something. And they don't just have their own beers; they have other craft beer as well. Oh and the patio...very nice when the weather is cooperative. Just go. You won't regret it.
