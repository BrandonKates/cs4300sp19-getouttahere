                "text": "My wife and I took my daughter on a campus visit this weekend.  My daughter loved the school and has the school on her list along with Colorado State among others.\n\nI on the other hand was somewhat disappointed.  It was just not a very welcoming experience.  The students that were providing the various tours were polite enough but it wasn\u2019t really a,\u201d Welcome to aTm! We are so glad that you\u2019re considering us!\u201d.  Instead it was, \u201cHowdy, consider yourself fortunate enough if you are accepted.\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve been to plenty of campuses to include CU (Boulder), UT (Austin), Baylor (Waco), UCSB (Santa Barbara), etc.  Some campus visits required a fee but they also provided meals, parking and swag.  They gave you the feeling of belonging and you wanted to enroll there.  \n\naTm on the other hand wanted to show how big they were, how much everything would cost and if you wanted to visit various areas of the campus, they made a profit by charging you parking at every opportunity.  \n\nI was slightly surprised as you would think the 3rd largest university in the country would have the assets to provide parking waivers or a day pass for visiting parents.\n\nThe amenities and facilities were very nice and what you would expect from a top tier university.  The campus was clean and various construction was occurring to indicate growth.\n\nWe were slightly surprised that the campus was beginning to feel cramped as it appears they had surrounding acreage to expand.  \n\nWith that being said, the nursing school did seem to be a good distance from the main campus.  So they might be working on this type of expansion.\n\nAs a helpful suggestion, offer parking passes to registered visitors (even if they have to pay for it). Along with google links to the various schools of interest for visitors.  As Google maps has not been updated in some time and some of the college of study were outdated.  (This might be something the computer science students could work on?)",

He and his wife did nothing to stop this. He spent much of his time walking into the back and talking with the wait staff ignoring the situation.

I'm still hearing about how beautiful our venue was, and all credit goes to Veritas. The catering is out of this world good - like really good! Definitely not your average, just so-so wedding food. No, it was AMAZING! Our accommodates for the day were picture perfect, and I could not be happier. Taylor (event manager) is fantastic - she really delivered on all accounts! We loved our wedding day for many reasons, but Veritas is certainly one of the top reasons! I would recommend everyone get married there!",
