Born a slave in Turkey, Qutb rose to prominence as a general during Muhammed Ghari's invasion of India in the 1180s. After Muhammed's assasination in 1206, Qutb seized the throne and crowned himself Sultan of the Mamluk dynasty, often disparagingly called the \"Slave Dynasty\" after Qutb's origins. Although the dynasty lasted for only a few centuries, Muslim rule in India endured up to the British occuption in 1858.\nQutb was a fanatical Muslim. When his garison occupied Delhi under the command of Muhammed Ghari in 1192, he ordered the destruction of twenty-seven Hindu and Jain temples to furnish building materials for the construction of Delhi's first mosque. Quwwat-ul-Islam, the \"Glory of Islam,\" was hastily erected by the young amir, who conscripted an army of local craftsmen, presumably Hindus, to assemble the structure. The Hindu stonemasons repurposed\u00a0columns from the destroyed temples, but adapting them to use in a mosque proved problematic given Islam's injunction against the use of images in temples. The masons were forced to plaster over the highly sculpted Hindu columns and presumably cover them with geometric designs. However, after centuries of neglect the plaster has fallen away, revealing the original Hindu carvings.\nThe Quwwat-ul-Islam is best known for its tower of victory, celebrating the Muslim conquest of India. It is built of red sandstone, gray quartz, and white marble, but is probably inspired by the iron \"Pillar of the Law\" that stands on the site. Built in the Mauryan dynasty in the 6th century, it is the only piece of the temple that stands in its original location. Qutb built around it when he constructed the mosque. Although made of iron, it has resisted rust for over 1,500 years, evidence of the Mauryan's superb metallurgical skills.", "time": 1549701965}, {"author_name": "Geetha Pai", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104548967242982440199/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I1nUTsDxZlA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAApI/4XgxMOo3TGs/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 3, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Considered as the oldest mosque in India, the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque was built by Qutub-ud-din-Aibak. \nMany parts were added to this mosque by his successors too.\nIt is in ruins today\nMohammed Ghori of Ghazni in Afghanistan defeated Prithviraj Chauhan, the last Hindu monarch of Delhi, in 1191\nHe entrusted Qutbuddin Aibak, his slave, as administrator of this territory.\nUpon Ghori\u2019s death in 1206, Aibak became independent & laid the foundations of the Delhi Sultanate\nOne of his first tasks was to create a  mosque & he chose Rai Pithora, as the site.\n27 Hindu & Jain temples were destroyed to build the mosque.\nConstruction of the mosque started in 1193 & completed in 1197.\nAn inscription carved over the eastern gate of the mosque records the presence of Hindu ornamentation in a Muslim mosque.", "time": 1547471813}, {"author_name": "Dr Karthik Venegalla", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103197096274636677026/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-9j1EpaPE26Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAATPE/uqm5Y-gAWEQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "8 months ago", "text": "A historic Mosque located inside the Qutb Complex.

The Club organized a Durga puja the same year on an open ground. The puja went off well, but there was little surplus fund and which to initiate the building of a Kalibari. The members were undaunted and the search for a site continued. One winter morning, one of the pioneeras came to the ground at the foot of Swami Malai hillock and felt that the undulating land,a little above the ground level, but not too high, could be an ideal place for the abode of Kali. The Welfare Association of sector 7, Ramakrishna Puram heartily endorsed the idea.\n\nA temporary temple was constructed on Saturday the 13th July, 1968 under heavy downpour and an idol donated by Srimati Purnima Gupta was installed on the same day which the organizers started worshiping regularly. This small image is now preserved in the permanent temple as ADI DEVI.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThere were some objections from Delhi Development Authority against the construction of the temporary temle and demolition action was initiated. Not only the members resisted, their housewives of the area came forward too. On one occasion when the men were away at their work, women kept the demolition squad at bay. B.K. Handa and family resisiding close to the Kalibari gave remarkable service.\n\nIn July 1968 an adhoc committee was formed for the Kalibari Association with the Late Shri. Nalani Ranjan Ghosh, M.P as President, Chitta Basu M.P as working President, Anil Kumar ghosh as Secretaty and Durgajati Bose as Treasurer. Nalani Babu got the demolition proceedings stopped and moved the Minister for the allotment of land to the temple. A committee was formed of Sarvarshi Bose H.K., Chanda M.L., Chatterjee B.K., Dutta S.K., Ghosh\u00a0 Anil Kumar and Sen P.C, to draft a suitable constitution. The draft prepared by Shri.Dutta S.K was ultimately adopted with suitable modifications. Certain provisions of the constitution were consciously kept flexible with a view to cater to the growing need in changed circumstances.\n\nThe first elected Excutive committee was formed in December 1969 with Shri. Kishore Kr. Palit as the first General Secretary. On the death of Shri. N.R. Ghosh,\u00a0 Shri. N.C. Chatterjee was elected as the President. The association got registered. Shri. V.V.Giri, President of India visited Kalibari during the celebration of Durga Puja in 1969.
