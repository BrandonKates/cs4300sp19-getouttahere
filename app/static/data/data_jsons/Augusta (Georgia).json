The waitstaff are inattentive every time I have ever eaten here, probably due to Management preying on college students desperate for a job they can show up to hungover. \n\nHere's a short story for you.  I placed a carry out order this morning for a very simple, standard diner omelette: a western omelette and home fries. I get home, excited to pop some hot home fries in my mouth and they were cold! Cold home fries should have been a warning that something was off but my omelette was hot so there is hope. First cut into the eggs, I get that nice crisp egg from an American style omelette and a bit of tomato. I get a bit of wheat toast to go with the egg and to my dismay, it's just bread. Hmm, I'll just move this to the side and focus on this omelette, it's pretty good. Next, cut has more egg, tomato and this white stuff starts oozing out. I think to myself, do they put ricotta cheese in an omelette. Do they mean West Italy for their omelette? Nope, it was sour cream. Not just an accent of sour cream, I could probably deal with that and move on with my day. No, this was \"Fill a Pringles Can\" worth of sour cream. There must be a mistake here, I'll give them a call to sort it out. \n\nI place the call and the polite girl that took my order answers. I ask could there be a mistake with my order and the politeness fades instantly. She insists I ordered a Southwest Omelette and explains what's in it. I tell her that I ordered a western omelette and it shouldn't have sour cream. She doubles down and says that's what I ordered. At this point, I'm fed up with this service. She insists that I cannot bring it back and have it remade. I tipped this girl 25% on a carryout order because of the kindness she displayed initially. I am very disappointed in this establishment. \n\nIf she was unwilling to have it remade, that tells me management is pressuring the staff to not fix errors. I hope that the alumni nostalgia of this diner is enough to keep your business running.", "time": 1554911574}]}, "status": "OK"}, "purpose": ["friends", "spring break"], "cost": ""}, "Beamie's at the River": {"type": "eat", "description": ["seafood", "joint", "indoor", "outdoor", "seating", "savannah", "river", "popular", "amongst", "locals"], "coordinates": [33.47746, -81.966504], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJF-dGrW_M-YgRn12KgE1x4sw", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Cotton Patch Bar": {"type": "drink", "description": ["located", "next", "river", "walk", "live", "music", "weekends"], "coordinates": [33.477299, -81.964885], "website": "http://eatdrinkbehappy.com/", "place_id": "ChIJfeYj1W_M-YgR4HyQePM8nxY", "reviews": null, "purpose": ["friends", "spring break"], "cost": ""}, "Metro Coffee House": {"type": "drink", "description": ["coffee", "shop", "day", "becomes", "bar", "night", "live", "jazz", "saturday", "nights"], "coordinates": [33.476801, -81.971073], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJy5LRPWnM-YgRgq5LKpsO5iI", "reviews": null, "purpose": ["friends", "spring break"], "cost": ""}, "Still Water Tap Room": {"type": "drink", "description": ["nan"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJX_rqyW7M-YgR3QEYtkSlKNA", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Nacho Mama's": {"type": "drink", "description": ["great", "mexicali", "style", "burritos", "nachos", "obviously"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJ-yjPyW7M-YgRk3itlkvtb_g", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "Joe's Underground Cafe": {"type": "drink", "description": ["great", "local", "dive", "bar", "located", "basement", "8th", "street", "often", "live", "music"], "coordinates": [33.475497, -81.96504499999999], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJgyjjIm7M-YgR7avk9ATjBF0", "reviews": null, "purpose": ["friends", "spring break"], "cost": ""}, "Augusta Marriott Hotel and Suites": {"type": "sleep", "description": ["ideally", "located", "heart", "downtown", "business", "district", "banks", "savannah", "river"], "coordinates": [33.479001000000004, -81.96759200000001], "website": "http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/agsmc-augusta-marriott-at-the-convention-center/", "place_id": "ChIJ39debW_M-YgRtWbYueRoiIk", "reviews": null, "purpose": [], "cost": ""}, "AmeriSuites -
