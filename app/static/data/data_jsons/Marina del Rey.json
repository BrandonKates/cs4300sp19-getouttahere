Service was fantastic! The owner, Craig I think, was so thoughtful and accommodating. We got a table at the window with the boats view and offered a free sweet treat at the end. The food, kale and salmon salad and a steak were just right. I often struggle with restaurant food being too salty or too greasy for me. That was not the case here, our meal was light, fresh and very yummy. And I highly recommend fruit tart for desert too!
