The Japanese garden is beautiful. There are walking trails and exhibitions where you can learn about the Japanese culture and the Japanese families that settled in the area. Everything is beautifully maintained and a great place to bring your family and friends. You can enjoy a nature walk, the cafeteria, the gift shop, or just sit on one of the many donated benches to enjoy the breeze and the beautiful landscape.",

There are, however, plenty of benches and the paths are pretty flat. If you don't have time or the inclination to walk all the way around the loop, head left out of the main building. There is a lovely waterfall right away on the left. On the next major peninsula, there is the original building with a nice history of the founder posted in it. Along with bathrooms and drinking fountains. Watch for iquanas and gold fish (by the old building). And sit a spell in silence and ponder the views or your navel! Small gift shop and usually an art exhibit in the main building. We heard the cafe was quite nice, but arrived too late to try it. Definitely recommend. Wear walking shoes a hat, and bring water and a camera!",

Place is still packed out the door but honestly I\u2019m not impressed. I got the pulled pork sandwich which came with a few fries a good amount of pork and I got a piece of cornbread to go with it which was extra. First the pork was pretty dry.  Definitely not impressed. Cornbread was not moist either it was very gritty and kind of nasty. This place has gone way downhill in my opinion. Girl at the front was super nice and took good care of me. But the food to me is subpar. Honestly I could crush their barbecue in my backyard. I just Feel this place is totally dropped the ball. At least with the pulled pork. Pulled pork is much better from the tiny buffet at whole foods.",

Yet another dissapointment. Had to come home andput the pizza in our own oven. Not even a busy night for them. Such a shame. \"Used to go here once a week. But the last couple of times we have been disappointed. The food quality has gone seriously downhill. The pizza is not cooked as much as it was in the past and is soggy and toppings have been sparse. Hope Management fixes this location soon.\"",

Our waiter was really on top of things and kept our glasses full and kept checking to see if we were satisfied. The salads were very fresh and tasty. I do recommend the wedge salad because it is excellent and a good value.",

When the place is full the acoustics make it so that you have to practically shout to the person next to you to have a conversation. Not only that but they play music over the soundsystem at nightclub level. It actually is loud enough to damage your hearing. We asked them to turn the music down which they never did and actually turned it up louder. I would never go to eat there again. Maybe get takeout or sit on the patio if they have a table available because the food is delicious but I would rather put a spike in my head than sit through another meal there.  I don't understand that mentality of making the place so noisy. A big part of going out to eat is enjoying the food and conversation. How can you do that when you are in a meat grinder of noise?",

They tried to sit us in a dark corner in an area where no one else was sitting (take a wild guess what color my husband is -_-), which I didn't like and asked to be moved. **note that tables were open all around amongst the other diners there** Once we were moved we met our waiter who seemed nice but once he took our order, he disappeared for the rest of the night. Never checked on us, we didn't get refills on our drinks, and once we were ready to go we sat for about 10 min. until we finally called out to another waiter to give us to-go boxes and our check. I would like to think that this was a fluke and maybe an emergency came up but we saw our waiter as we were leaving. He didn't say a word. I'm so sad because I work in the area and order from here. I bragged about this place to my husband and he wasn't impressed. They let me down \ud83d\ude11. Moral of the story... food is great but you have to choose between your morals or your stomach.",

As I walked up to the restaurant I couldn\u2019t help but head tires screeching in the parking lot from a car driving way too fast, turns out it was a valet in a customers car, he\u2019s lucky it was not mine! I reported this to the gal up front who offered genuine concern.  Our server seemed generally annoyed by my parents, granted they annoy me too, but the server should have a little more patience. After I mentioned that to him he seemed a bit better. The sides are mediocre at best. The dessert was tasty. I think for what they are trying to be they are currently missing the mark.",

The server poured it from a container into peoples cups directly.  Utensils for desert not provided until after desert was served. When I asked about silverware, server told me they are behind me. Main course served on small plate, no room for \"family style sides\" on plate. No extra plate provided. \n\nDrinks were brought slowly. When taking orders the server started with me. As the host of the party I wanted her to take my guests order first and suggested this. It was a problem for her and she said as much. \n\nTable was not completely cleared between courses. There were extra glasses left on the table. \n\nOverall poor service.\n\nHowever the party planner Jamie was fantastic to work with. Very accommodating, pleasant and efficient.",
