The entire meal was definitely not \"grilled\" hibachi style.  It was semi cold, as if it had been warmed up.  The meat had no grill char on it.  The rice was clearly from a large pot of rice, and the veggies from a large vat of boiling veggies in sauce.  The soup appetizer had no flavor and actually tasted rather musty.
