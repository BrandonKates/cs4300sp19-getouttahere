The staff at the pool were so welcoming and helped us with pool passes, drinks, and even got us reservations for dinner that evening. Tucker you are the best. We then went upstairs and had wonderful drinks. We came back the following evening for pre-dinner snacks. I absolutely suggest visitors of death valley make time to check this place out. Wonderful place for a break from camping and enjoy some luxury in the desert.",

It would have been nice if the reception staff when checking us in had bothered to enquire if we had made any dinner reservations (restaurant turned out to be fully booked), or told us the other dinner option closed at 8pm. Pool was very nice, only good thing to be said.",

The Inn's restaurant is likewise expensive, but understandable given its location. The menu offerings are limited and the portions are small. Having stayed at the ranch, there is much more value there. Their recent remodel took away much of the charm and added lots of expense.",
