                "text": "I have never had a WORSE restaurant experience in my life!!!  (And just for background, I'm 47, eat out a lot, and worked both as a waitress and bartender while going to college and graduate school.)\n\nLast Saturday (2/23/13,) four of us arrived at the Cowboy at about 7:45 pm.  There were no available tables, so we decided to take a seat at the bar.  I ordered an \u201coat martini.\u201d  (I didn\u2019t have the drink menu in front of me, but had had the drink there a couple of weeks before).  The bartender said \u201cI\u2019ve worked here since we opened, and we\u2019ve NEVER served ANY alcohol made from oats.\u201d  (The emphasis was hers.)\n\nI was flustered, because, as I said, I had had the drink there a couple of weeks before; so I ordered \u201cthe basil drink.\u201d  As the bartender began making \u201cthe basil drink,\u201d I looked at the menu.  There at the bottom of the list was the \u201cHigh West Martini\u201d made with, you guessed it, oat vodka.  [From the High West Distillery website: \u201cThe heart of Vodka 7000\u201d comes from our favorite grain, oats\u2026.That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created Vodka 7000\u2019, the only vodka in the world that\u2019s made from oats.\u201d]  \n\nI called over to the bartender saying \u201cHere it is on the menu, the \u201coat martini.\u201d  She brought over \u201cthe basil drink\u201d, set it in front of me and said, \u201cHere\u2019s YOUR BASIL drink!\u201d  (Again, the emphasis was hers.)  I said \u201cI want the \u201coat martini.\u201d\n\nThen things got weird.  She said \u201cNext time you order the drink, say I want the High West Martini.  In fact, I\u2019m going to have them re-print the menu and remove the words \u201coat\u201d altogether.\u201d \n\nWell here\u2019s where she made a HUGE mistake \u2013 she assumed I\u2019d come back - AND I NEVER WILL.  \n\nI paid for the drink \u2013 and left immediately!!!

I thought he was being nice until the bill arrived and I saw they had charged me $9 for Cokes. I was livid. I asked the ditzy blonde at the bar, and she just said so sorry, there's nothing we can do. Soon the owner came out and was also unapoligetic. He called me cheap and an a--hole!!! If I could give this place minus five stars, I would. \n\nOwner's self-righteous response is ridiculous.  By the way, the three Cokes you served equated to about one Coke because of all the ice and the small glasses. And the only restaurants I've ever been to that charge for refills are in Lake Placid. I've been traveling to Estes Park, Colo. annually for 22 years and have spent thousands of dollars there. I was hoping I'd love Lake Placid the same way, but my experience with rude New Yorkers like you convinced me never to return. Nice job",

It\u2019s only 8 minutes away from Mirror lake and the best part that it has an outdoor seating area where you can eat and chill. Their menu offers a wide variety of food and their sea food section is what attracts people the most to go and try. Me and my husband ordered \u201cto go\u201d a Hot Lobster roll and a Cold Lobster roll. Maybe those two dishes sounds pretty much the same but definitely taste different. The Hot Lobster Roll is a lobster sandwich marinated only with butter and served hot and The cold Lobster Roll is a cold lobster sandwich with mayo, lettuce and celery. Both platters were served with French Fries and potato salad. Their food tasted like Heaven and they were both yummy and flavorful. Unfortunately, their service is a bit slow but Be patient Guys because it\u2019s definitely worth it!!",

Though somewhat casual, the service and food was far superior to a much more upscale restaurant we ate at last week for a celebration ration.  Complaints are just nits. One person's medium rare blackened stake with Brandy sauce was closer to medium.  I highly recommend the boathouse.",

They liked the lodge itself, though the service was average, and had a nice time but when they came home I saw that they were billed more than was agreed to. I had called several times to get a confirmation after I made the reservation and was told their system was down. When I called to try work it out after the stay I was told the manager would call me in a few hours. Then someone else called and said, without listening, that I was wrong and she was right. (I see on another recent review someone also had a tough time with the same person  and her dismissive approach). I asked again to speak to the manager and emailed him twice. It has been several days and he seems to have no interest in calling or responding which is very disappointing. I respect people are busy but a quick I got your email and will get back to you would have been nice or a simple conversation would have been helpful. This was our first experience with Whiteface Lodge and this total disregard from management negatively impacted our perception. I hate to think if they cannot address minor stuff what happens when it is a big issue? Too bad because the place was nice.",
