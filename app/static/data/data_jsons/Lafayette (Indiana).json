On weekends in particular, when the dorm cafeterias close, you won't hear a lot of English in the dining room... interestingly, there's a lot more Mandarin than Korean, but still.\n\nYou order at the window, and they bring the food out. Water and soup are both free and self-serve, which is a nice touch. You're encouraged to put away your own dishes.\n\nThe food quality is decent and plentiful. The staff is consistently friendly. We lean toward the spicy end of the menu. With kimchi soup, spicy squid and spicy pork, the menu gives plenty of choices. All in all, well worth a spot on the \"Where would you like to eat tonight?\" list, even if you're *not* an Asian Purdue student.",

Two of us ordered the same soup. Needless to say it really made our stomachs churn and ruined lunch for all five of us that had ordered. I called to speak to a manager. The woman that answered the phone was beyond rude. She had no idea what I was calling for and said \"they too busy to speak to you\". Mind you, I could have been calling for catering info because I had not given my reason for calling yet. When I insisted on needing to speak to a manager, the delivery manager got on the phone. I explained everything. She apologized and said \"Your next delivery order will be comped. I'm putting it in the book.\" (I didn't ask her to do this.) So we called today to order and spoke to the delivery manager who said she could only comp the cup of soup. Since that is not what she told me, I asked to speak to the GM who proceeded to say that they can only comp the soup. I asked if they record their calls -- they don't. Picture of the hair in the soup below. They need to learn about good customer service because we ordered regularly from them not only for a few of us but for team lunches to be catered in as well and we will not be doing that anymore. I don't normally complain. I never leave bad reviews but this is ridiculous. I didn't ask for our entire order to be comped, they volunteered it and then didn't honor it.",

Lafayette because the college crowd is not here, so there is actually some peace and it is not as chaotic. I've been here so many times and have never once been disappointed with my visit. They have live music on Fridays and Saturdays. You'll have a good time.",
