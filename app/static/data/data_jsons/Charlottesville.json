If you have never visited, this is a privately owned orchard that has built a business based on allowing people to come pick their own apples and peaches. There is also a barn that holds craft items and other goods like local jams and honey. If you do not want to go pick the fruit yourself, there are bins of apples by the barn in multiple varieties.  Pumpkins are available and hay rides seasonally. They also sell apple cider donuts that are amazing. The frozen cider is also the best as it is not overly sweet at all.  They also sell pies, hamburgers, hot dogs and other simple foods. There is a back porch with seating and great views.  There is also a bold rock cider tasting room.

Really enjoyed my entire visit. The photo opportunities are amazing. Make sure you bring a real camera and not just your cell phone. The walk is insane from the vineyard to the concession area where apple picking begins. But eating the grapes and berries along the way made up for it. Also a word to the wise make sure to where hiking boots for a better experience.",

My suggestions is ordering two tapas/aps per person and sharing them. It\u2019s not just another \u201cupscale tapas\u201d restaurant - the food is unique and different than ordinary restaurants. \n\nWhile I would consider the food to be upscale, do not feel like you have to dress up fancy to go here, but look nice.

I love love love coming here for breakfast lunch or dinner, they are even worth the stop in just for a cup of coffee in the morning, it will definitely brighten your day!",

He promised to come back to get our food order three times. He brought us bread and butter with no silverware or napkins. We decided not to get an appetizer and ordered our food as soon as we were given the opportunity. It was over an hour before we were fed. The food was excellent as always. In the past the service has always been excellent which is why this is our favorite place to eat when we go out. This poor guy needs some remedial training for fine dining service.

This buffet was labelled as fit and healthy so we were also excited for some amazing healthy stuff. Since we reached there just when the buffet started so we thought main course items are yet to be kept. To our greatest surprise there was no main course. So the menu comprised of salads and desserts which is so weird and bizarre. The only main course option was cold burger and cold sandwich which was terrible. Except for khao suey soup and couple of salads n desserts, majority of the offerings were average to below average. The most horrific of all was papadi chaat where the ingredients were papadi and dahi, neither it was healthy nor justified to not put basic ingredients. Healthy doesn't mean non inclusion of basic items. With salads which anyways is an indispensable part of the buffet plus umpteen desserts which has nothing to do with healthiness this buffet was the worse ever experience so far. Coming to their service, it was again not even close to what we expected. The serving folks lacked basic skills in regard to everything. The only sigh of relief was the ambience which was surely in line with what we expected. Overall not suggested in any case!!!",

Just get a reservation or you'll be waiting a while.\n\nOver multiple visits, everything I ordered was excellent. The sushi tasted fresh, and this is one of the only places in Charlottesville you can get decent unagi (eel) rolls. I also loved the marbled tuna sushi. It's got the perfect mix of fat and tender meat creating a thick, luxurious texture, augmenting the already rich taste. It's not for everyone but if you like fat and sushi, you have to get it.\n\nThe lobster tempura was good, juicy with a delicious sauce, but slightly overdone. The wagyu beef was served on a hot rock, and cooked to perfection. Just had such a rich taste and texture that it melted in my mouth. The harami trio was good, well cooked and seasoned, but not to the level of the wagyu steak.\n\nDeserts were also excellent. I really enjoyed the puffy and light donuts with coffee as well as the rich, crumbly chocolate cake with ice cream. Mochi ice cream was unremarkable, but good.",

After seeing the new menus that descriptively show the individual sushi rolls, we were curious to try the new additions.

Our server was also more attentive to our needs than previous servers. We very much enjoyed this visit.",

My daughter's favorite is tomato basil soup and this was some of the best we have ever had.  And the chocolate truffles were over the top!  We might have hid some for just our family.  \nThe serving staff were attentive yet unobtrusive.  Our kitchen looked better after they left than before they started.

I felt so comfortable knowing that I had Vickie to help organize rentals (glasses, linens, tables, etc), decide how much alcohol to get, set up the space, etc. She truly is a catering expert and was unbelievably helpful with all of our questions/concerns. During cocktail hour, Vickie specifically sought out my husband and I to bring us appetizers and drinks. But most importantly, the food was OUTSTANDING! All my guests were raving about how it was the best wedding food they had ever had. All the meats were juicy and tender, the ingredients were fresh, and everything was flavorful. The wait staff was friendly and fun to have at the wedding. The price was higher than some places in the area, but lower than many others as well. I feel it was a good value. Would choose L'Etoile again a million times over!",

Another nice feature is that they bring fresh bread to your table one basket at a time. Everything I tried was good, but there was also a Chef's Special Chicken that was amazing, it was tandoori cooked so it was smokey and tender, but it had a more cumin based spice blend that I really enjoyed. The rice pudding with cashews was excellent, lightly sweet and satisfying. Definitely will come back!",

One thing I really appreciated was the salad, which had cucumbers, red onion, and tomatoes, as well as a good creamy dressing. Another nice feature is that they bring fresh bread to your table one basket at a time. Everything I tried was good, but there was also a Chef's Special Chicken that was amazing, it was tandoori cooked so it was smokey and tender, but it had a more cumin based spice blend that I really enjoyed. The rice pudding with cashews was excellent, lightly sweet and satisfying. Definitely will come back!",

And when we moved here I was so excited to see that there was a location near us. We drove from Lafayette to dine here because we loved the locations in Georgia so much. I was so disappointed. More like heartbroken. Our buffalo pizza stopped being made halfway up the pizza leaving a thick piece of crust. Our bbq chicken side was burnt. We asked for no onions on both sides there were onions. The crust was not like the other locations. It was hard. My son got the pretzel bites the only good thing that came to our table. It's what I expected my crust on my pizza to be. Our waitress forgot about us once it got busy. The host was the only reason this place got 2 stars. She was amazing and so friendly with my son. I think it needs to meet the management at other locations. Next time we will wait till I visit my in laws in Georgia. Such a huge let down. And dont tell me about it being burnt because it goes into an oven when 2 completely different locations have the same crust and same quality of food on the opposite sides of Georgia. There's something not right with this location.",
