It\u2019s a bit too small for that. However, if you pair it with lunch or dinner at nearby eateries, it makes for a nice, relaxing trip. If you\u2019re an artist or art appreciator, I\u2019m sure you will find a few things within the exhibits to make it worthwhile. =)\n\nWhat really enchanted me were the cabinets near the entrance, where you could temporarily store your belongings or coat.
