You can tell the park is well-kept, even though there\u2019s been some work going on with uprooted trees (maybe from the recent floods?) The trails were clear and well marked and there was no trash. There is plenty of parking, and the entrance fees are $5 per person. It\u2019s a pet-friendly area as well and looks like a great place to bring your furry friends. The entrance attendant was friendly and let us know the park closes at sundown - gates are locked at that point. I plan to return soon for a great day of picnicking and hiking!",

Nice mini kitchens with all the necessary dishes, cutlery, pots, pans and utensils provided. Good refrigerator, electric stove and oven are provided for your use. Cable TV. Air-conditioning and a fireplace.  Very clean shower and small vanity sink. Our rustic and cozy cabin had 2 comfortable twin beds as it was my elderly mother and myself staying about 4 or 5 nights. Your bed linens are furnished.  If you have a physical handycap, you need to discuss that with the reservation staff when you call to make reservations. Most of the cabins are difficult to get into from the asphalt roads; the pathway from where your car is parked to the door of the porch is rather uneven and is rough going for use of a walker of any kind, but not impossible. If you use a wheelchair, this is not the place for you. There are no sidewalks (as of summer of 2017). Fortunately, my mother was in very good condition for her age (84) and wasn't using any cane or walker at all.  Book your stay 4 to 6 months in advance.  The staff are very pleasant, efficient and helpful; they will happily answer all of your questions! A great place for enjoying nature, relaxing and unwinding, and for daily exercise. And it is quiet!",

The playground is without a doubt the best one around here, and perhaps in the city (I haven't seen every single one, so I can't say definitively \ud83d\ude0a). It is set in a ton of mature trees so there is plenty of shade which really helps when it's warm/hot out. There are bathrooms to the side of the playground and they're in good condition. There are picnic tables perfect for snacks, any meal, or just sitting down while the kids run themselves straight into nap time or bed time.\n\nThe equipment itself is perfect. Every thing is constructed of wood and feels so natural in the setting in the woods. There are plenty of adventures to be had for all ages. My 3&5 yo love it, and my 12 yo enjoys going as well. Lots to climb on, swing on, explore, and really let their imaginations go wild.\n\nIf you haven't been here, pack up and go today, you will be so glad you did!",

That always makes for the best wings. The fries are great. They are long, thin, and wide.  A tad crunchy on the outside while soft inside.  They have some really good lunch specials.  Tuesdays has great deals on traditional and boneless chicken wings.  The bar is a smoking section and there's a separate dining room that's non smoking.  Nice patio dining areas for warmer weather.  The sweet tea is always very good and sweet.  Hardly ever seems too busy at dinner.  Lunch can be pretty packed sometimes.  They seem to keep staff low due to lesser amounts of customers so it can be a little slow on the service side if busy.  That said the servers always work hard and do a great job!",

There aren't many restaurants that actually serve spicy food when the title says \"spicy\". This one really is spicy. They have other spicy dishes and they mark them on level of spicynes so you know ahead of time. If you take kids they tend to bring their meal out first which I like. You choose where to sit they have booth like areas as well as tables. They bring your food to you. For a family of 5 all of which ordered food & drinks we spend around $60 not bad. Kids plates are reasonably big. We always have left overs. They have chicken tenders, cheese pizza, spaghetti and Mac and cheese for kids menu. Nice relaxed place to go to.",

Our waitress Sue actually helps make them. The staff spends hours making them. They fry them to order. My entree was amazing next time I'll get it at 3 stars of heat. My date got a curry dish and I liked it more than my noodle dish. For kids I would suggest the chicken appetizer with some rice and more spring rolls. The wait staff was amazing. Definitely will be going back and sending all of my friends and family.",

That's kinda pricey to me, although I would not have minded so much if the food was worth it! I don't know if they change the original recipes for a cheaper vendor or what their thought process was either way they have failed epically bad! We used to love the mild teriyaki boneless wings, not anymore.

I would recommend you to pick another place. This one will never turn around for the better.\n\n**Update 2: 3 months later. One thing has improved the staff is the same, but with that it includes same old problems.  The staff at the cashier still very rude, unattentive, lack the enthusiasm that makes me wonder, why I came back. My response the wife really enjoyed the food, but with no lemonade and the same bad service for me is an easy pass. Still 2yrs since the first time and a complete debacle on service management and lack of improvement. Not my first choice. Yes demotion to 2 stars, why no improvement over the service, food or even the environment. \n\n**Update: 1 month later. Staff changed, menus changed and the service still as bad as before. Waited easily 40min only 3 tables served and no rush. So far they are keeping up the bad service over and over. \n\nService on decline. I have been at the place several times and with the management changes, I have seen how the service has taken a wrong turn. The place it is in a great location, but the staff keeps changing every other month. If there\u2019s that much change it seems that the management is not able to keep their staff, so they are constantly figuring out how to in put your order. The last time the place was empty and the staff (all males) were pretty much more competing against each other to pick up a girl outside of the store. They pass each other comments and signals (clerk, 2 at the kitchen and one around the tables). I am a guy and I get it, but if you have to ask me 3 times about the same order and is just me ordering with no line. Please take the order and then move on. This place was one a weekly thing, but due to things like that, forgetting orders, ignoring customers or not having lemonades well is now more a one in a-few. The food is good, not great but good. If you want to change your routine it won\u2019t be bad if you know what to expect at the location. Avoid weekdays or Saturdays at lunchtime it is near impossible to order, due to being very crowded.",

Immediately as you get to the restaurant outside you have beautiful Japanese garden with some gorgeous prize-winning goldfishes. They kids had so much fun looking at them swimming and everything.  After all of that excitement we were able to be seated at a Japanese Hibachi Table with another family and kids so my children had a lot of fun interacting with everyone else around the table. As the chef came in he quickly started his show and it was fun interactive and very energetic. There was so much food!!!! Your portions are very large so make sure you come hungry. the typical Hibachi chicken dinner included rice vegetables and before that you get to have soup and salad. The only reason I took a star of was that the food was not as flavorful or authentic as I am used to but for being Japanese attraction chain spot it was sort of expected to be a little Bland however it was perfect for kiddos taste buds.",

Said to the waiter that I wanted it cooked medium rare plus and then said maybe it should be medium.  He told me that it cooks very fast and I should order it medium rare.  I said okay and chose to have it cooked without butter.  I like to taste the meat.  You can put butter on feathers and it will taste great.  I guess that when they cook it and add the butter it makes the meat taste better than it really is.  So out comes our dinner and my steak is RARE and not even close to medium rare.   I ate a few bites because I was really hungry and I noticed it had a lot of pepper on it.  I finally flagged down our waiter and showed him the steak.  He agreed that it was rare and offered to bring me a hot plate, whatever good that would do, or take it back and cook it some more, which would probably dry the steak.  Since most of our party was well along in the meal, I opted to finish my steak, which by the way was not that good.  Maybe I should have had the butter.  I have had better meat from Costco prime steaks.  What a waste of money!",
