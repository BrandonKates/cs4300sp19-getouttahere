I've driven passed this place many times thinking I've got to try that place.  I finally did, and I'm kicking myself for not eating here sooner.  It was REALLY good!  The place itself was very clean and tastefully decorated.  Has about 20 tables, well staffed and knew the food.  Ordered chicken egg rolls for appetizer and plate had 4 large egg rolls sliced in half that were very tasty with sweet & sour sauce.  Ordered the Ocho Thai Seafood at a level 5 (yes, I like spicy).  It had such great flavor.  Mixed seafood was shrimp, crab, scallops, fish, muscle, and at least a couple more, so lots of seafood with the veggies.  The sauce was what made it so special.  Most places are afraid to use spice to flavor the dish like they're going to offend you.  But they don't hold back here.  I can't wait to go back again to get this dish, and try a dessert.  The place was busy, lots of people eating in and some call in orders, but yet it was quiet and you can hear actual conversation.  Most of the tables were full of people, and I must say, not on their phones.  Overall a great dining experience.", "time": 1549334245}]}, "status": "OK"}, "purpose": ["friends"], "cost": ""}, "Yummy's": {"type": "eat", "description": ["popular", "greek", "mediterranean", "restaurant"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "nan", "place_id": "ChIJTZZ-94DKTYYR-EpnRF5IvRs", "reviews": null, "purpose": ["friends"], "cost": ""}, "Hannah's Off The Square": {"type": "eat", "description": ["casual", "fine", "dining", "restaurant"], "coordinates": [NaN, NaN], "website": "http://www.hannahsoffthesquare.com/", "place_id": "ChIJ7Q1MHovKTYYR-vW7SaI4s7E", "reviews": {"html_attributions": [], "result": {"price_level": 3, "rating": 4.4, "reviews": [{"author_name": "Clint Newell", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114737855895340708145/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-c6yVPxn0_v8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd0pLbYk3Z4xrYtXln-rsa2krpNuQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "in the last week", "text": "Visited the area with clients.
