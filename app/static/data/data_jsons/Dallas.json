Late night at the museum events are always fun too! Highly recommend for the whole family!",

I love nature and the rain forest environment is so beautiful and a feast for the eyes.. Of course, the animals were just delightful as well. The underwater life is also incredible especially the manatee. I urge everyone to go see and support this wonderful Dallas attraction",

The reason for 2 stars is because we had to wait in line outside in order to purchase our ticket. Okay no big deal, most places like this you do. BUT waiting in line as you make your way throughout the aquarium... never before have I had to do this. Yes I understand crowds and such but the layout is very narrow when it's very crowded. We stood in line for maybe 25 to 30 minutes and then inside while trying to see animals a good 10 minutes before the line even moved. Stroller took up walkways. People standing in the walk way blocking traffic. There was no room to go around or anything. I honestly thought this would be a great experience but it sucked. I disliked it and for the price we paid, was not worth the money in my opinion.",

That said, now we say this:\n\nDallas city council and the mayor taking the sides of illegals and promoting Sanctuary Cities in defiance of the federal government is a type of Confederacy. This so-called stand holds the illegals in their custody to make them weak toys easily broken for Confederate plots. They should be in Mexico making it strong. These players can't see it now as didn't the states that broke from our Union in the 1860's. Isn't Tennell Atkins and the others a bunch of silly GOOSE for saying TEAR DOWN THE WHITES HISTORY  because it's Nazi Germany! Robert E. Lee wasn't Hitler, who purposely rounded up the Jews to be killed. U monsters are more like Hitler than you will admit with this twisted rhetoric and hype against statues of exquisite design and prominence . That's what it is, isn't it? You wanna dominate history too! You wanna dominate our past, too. You're precious mentally ill vicious control freaks!!! Everything you accused the confederacy of.\n\nEven the Sheriffs came up in a cluster saying we don't want to capture Illegal aliens opposing federal law like the conferates.\n\nThis is a classic Mandella Effect. Remembering the past in a way it wasn't so you could shoot Tupoc.\nAnoherwords, those statues are part of something not related to you holding office or not hindering you in anyway, but you still want to stomp on it. Showing off your tough guy faces?\n\nYou don't wanna face your history came over here in a crate, naked and docile instead of fighting to hold onto your little piece of Africa, as the Indians fought long and hard. So you fight  now? Isn't you being a prominent  asset in Dallas City Hall Council Chambers a big enough statement?\nDo you have to be destructive?.\nDo you have to get into our stuff, too?\n\nStop looking for ways to say no Jesus Christ evolution because you don't wanna walk in yours!\n\nAnd for that reason, the fate of the History of Man shouldn't be in your hands\"\n\n] \"We got more votes than you do on the city council.\"\n\nOooh! Oooh! I  told you! It's power vs. history, an immovable fact you want to eradicate from our memories.\nControl freaks! Control freaks!\n\nTaking those statues down isn't playing by the law\"\n\nSomeday, I hope your scuzzy hatefulness is undone - 1 Timothy 4.1\n(Hypocrisy is terror/hype)\nVery petty people - Not safe for regular votes.",

It wasn't as we all waited 15 min for drinks and I waited 30 additional min for my adult beverage... Food wasn't great either. My lasagna was just sauce and pasta with hardly any meat on it. Didn't really taste great either. It seemed like teenagers were running the place and they didn't seem like they wanted to be there. Will never go back... Had better Italian food at Angie's Italian restaurant in Barberton.",

I would definitely dress well to come to this location. Last I remember they do have a dress code, at least for the late night dancing they certainly do. In terms of the food service, the food is hit or miss honestly. It used to be a lot better 8-10 years ago, but I feel there have been a lot of changes and the food just isn't quite what it used to be. I recommend the pupusas, the fajita nachos, and the Salvadorian sampler/mix plate (I can't remember exactly what it's called). The drinks are definitely better than the food here so make sure to order a margarita or cocktail drink as that is their strong suit. You don't need more than 2 to have a great evening.",

Amazing start to my meal and the shrimp and grits entree was also incredible. My fianc\u00e9 had steak which was also very well prepared and juicy. Second time we had brunch and it was amazing! The chicken and waffles were a generous portion with a delicious hot sauce. The French toast had great texture and flavor. I would highly recommend the biscuits and grit tots, must try if you dine here.",

They also have special events especially around the holidays in the home. There's also restaurants and afternoon tea, which is very good, but pricey. It's beautiful all seasons of the year. They have many special events. The prices can be high, but if you are remember you get a reduced rate. It is definitely worth becoming a member because it cost $15 to park and $15 to get in. You will recoup your money within a couple of visits. You also get special invitations to members only events and previews for public events.",

It was spring break for my kids so I am sure if it was spring break here as one lady had asked if my kids were on spring break.\n\nThe exhibits are really cool. They definitely had an exhibit from 9/11. They even had some steel beams from one of the towers. Brought some sad and memorable times during that as I was deployed during this time.\n\nThey have the oval office where you can sit and pretend to be the president. If you purchase more than one photo its pretty reasonable for the price.\n\nAccess to it from the highway was a breeze. There are plenty of restaurants close to by choose and eat from. They even have a cafe located at the entrance of the museum so you don't have to travel far if you don't want to.\n\nDon't forget to download the app during your self guided tour.\n\nWe purchased the City Pass. I highly recommend it if you're interested in seeing the rest of Dallas. For family five it was $190 with tax. If you're not fast at sight seeing you have up to nine days to use the pass. My family and I were able to see everything in one day.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and fast. I definitely want to come back again.",

Then about a month into school, we got a teacher who didn't know anything.  In February, we got a teacher who knew the stuff, but by then, most of the students were horrible.  They were really awful to him.  He didn't give up though.  I know he wrote up some of the worst kids, but nothing ever happened to them, and they laughed about it.  I talked to kids in his engineering class who told me he was a teacher who cared about his students, but he didn't come back the next year.  There a lot of new teachers each year.  They need to do something about the kids who disrupt; they are trying to get into suspension.",

I walked up to the host, no welcoming or anything. I had to speak up and say I had a reservation. The host said they were getting my table ready, it was 7:25 pm when I asked. So, I waited a bit longer because they were just sitting people left and right. I didn't get a follow up so I walked up again by that time it was 7:40 pm. I asked again for my table & I was told they are now getting ready. I said is this the way reservations are handled. she said well we are super busy and were trying to do the best we can. NOT okay! Table was finally ready and we sat down by 7:55 pm. We were sat in a space so tight we should have just sat with the table behind us. Our waitress was not friendly at all, she just seemed more overwhelmed than anything. She would disappear so much. We had to ask for refills, chips and salsa. Food was okay. My beans were so hard I probably could hit someone with it. She was bothered because she had to split up up our tickets. Let's just say it wasn't a good experience and we won't return.",

Starter chips and salsa usually predict the quality of of the main course, and theirs did not disappoint. Flour tortillas are definitely fresh, with the oven in view spiraling them along. Waitstaff was friendly and timely, and food was served in short amount of time. Not sure how a busy lunch hour or Friday night would be, but expect that food quality and service would meet the demand.",

                "text": "Went in for Sunday brunch, found a mixed bag. Dining room was crowded though not full, took a couple seats in the bar area and had a bloody Mary that was truly great, though small. It was so good, and so small, I ordered a second one. Ordered the egg and pork nachos app to split. Delicious! But it took forever to get to us. The service through out the meal was sub par. Felt like we were forgotten. Then after another long wait we got our chicken fried steak and eggs. Potatos were great, the eggs were just about perfect, but the steak was underdone for CFS, and it was both over tenderized and too grizzly. Poor service and mixed food reviews will knock this iconic Oak Cliff kitchen out of the race with all the top notch competition in this neighborhood.",

                "text": "We visited this Cafe for the first time on what seem to be one of their busiest days (Sunday)!!!  The lines were very long and it was super crowded.  We had a huge take out order. So they rerouted all take out orders to the other side of the restaurant, instead of having us wait in the main order line, which was much more accommodating and it seem to make everything move along faster and smoother!!!  At that point they had me fairly impressed. Then came our turn to place our order, which I previously stated was quite hefty, but there was no problem at all!!!  They had at least two or three people at the counter to take the orders, so that no one had to wait on those of us who had large orders and took a lot of time doing so!!!  We placed our order and waited patiently, which didn't take as long as we had expected!!!  When our order was ready they took the time to check each and every order by what was on the order ticket, mind U our order was broken down into two separate tickets. When I tell U that we received each and everything we had ordered, I was really impressed!!!  \nI would just like to thank South Dallas Cafe for the exceptional service that we received, for accommodating us so well and all while doing it with a smile and being very friendly!!!  Ur whole staff made an impression on me that day and I must admit I'm not one to easily impress at all!!!  I will recommend Ur establishment to anyone who's looking for great service and a damn good meal...the food was good and very satisfying!!!  When I'm in town, South Dallas Cafe will always be my go to from now on...for excellent service and great food!!!  Thank U again and keep up the great work...establishments such as this are hard to come by these days!!!",

My cousin lives in Dallas so he recommended this place. We went on a sunday and it was packed but the wait didn't seem long. It's buffet style but the workers serve you. I ordered the ribs, greens and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was good but the greens and ribs were nasty and they give you this dry, hard cornbread muffin that had no taste to it. Seating was confusing. I had to get somebody to help us find a seat. For a minute it looked like we would have to stand there holding our trays until an empty table was available. I would not eat there again. 2 stars for the price and mac and cheese",
