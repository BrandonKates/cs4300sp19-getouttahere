The only problem I had with the entire experience was the pricing. And I lit the pricing go because it says chef. Anytime you see the word chef you are going to pay bigger money for Stuff. And although I enjoyed the fettuccine I don't know that it was worth 30 some dollars but it was good and Anne was nice enough to get me extra shrimp. It's a good little restaurant and I mean little.

Upon arrive the service had already proven itself terrible, as there was quite a wait just to be seated, even though it was empty.

When we asked for a booth, we were given a table that was half booth, half flimsy chairs that were somewhat falling apart. We asked for another table, but we were told that the other booths were dirty, and we would have to wait a bit to have them washed. Not wanting to spend more time waiting we sat down and waited another ten to fifteen minutes for our menu\u2019s and chip basket. My order and service were somewhat satisfactory from then on, but my friend\u2019s service got worse. She decided against her first choice after the waitress mentioned that it was served with a few things she didn\u2019t like. After looking over the menu she decided on the chicken burrito for $12.99, as it stated it came with cheese, lettuce and other toppings. When she ordered the burrito, the waitress said she would have to pay extra for anything the menu said it have. Though the worst events happened after she got her food, as her burrito was only shredded chicken wrapped in a shell with a small bit a cheese she had to pay extra for. After eating for a few minutes, she suddenly started gagging and pulled out a small hair from her mouth. When we told the waitress about it, she said we need to show her the hair for her to say anything to the cook. When my friend said she won\u2019t pay for the waitress to best put it got an attitude and told my friend she was being rude all day.
