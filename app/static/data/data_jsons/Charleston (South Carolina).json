Greta, the church's wedding coordinator, is extremely professional and *really* knows what she is doing! I'm disappointed to leave a less  than stellar review for a church,  however the minister - Cress Darwin - seems to have his head in the clouds and really drags the place down.\n\nMy (now) wife and I started attending in the summer of 2018, and discovered Cress was \"on a summer break\" and there were guest ministers filling his place. I had just proposed to my wife, and we were looking for a place for our ceremony and 2NDPC seemed to fit the bill. After Cress got back, we watched one or two of his sermons before we signed the paperwork, but gradually became more disenchanted with him.\n\nWhen it came time for our first marriage counseling, he tried swapping our meeting time on us by email just an hour before we were scheduled to meet, and we had already made the drive downtown. He didn't wait for confirmation that the new time would work for us, he just didn't show. When he finally arrived, he seemed to have no idea who we were, despite having previously talked with him numerous times by name, and had no idea what we were there for. When he finally got settled, his excuse for being late was that he was \"out at the stables riding horses with his daughter since she is home from boarding school.\" None of that seemed very minister-ly to us. The marriage counseling itself was very aggressive, and was not conducive to communication as he continued to make not-so-subtle hints as to how much money he and his family had/came from (apparently his daughters are \"sick of Paris\" because they've been there so many times already). \n\nWhen the 1 month mark hit for us to get married, we got a surprise email from Cress stating he was bailing on our wedding, and had arranged for a replacement for us. We were initially caught off guard, but eventually got over it and wound up liking the stand-in more than Cress, so it was a blessing in disguise.\n\nI'm not sure if he blew us off because our attendance began to wane as time went on - a direct product of my work schedule with the Navy being very inflexible and covering over service hours. Overall, we never established the kind of connection we were hoping to over the 6ish months we attended before our wedding.", "time": 1550858694}, {"author_name": "Kourtney Fitzgerald", "author_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103310906582758325308/reviews", "language": "en", "profile_photo_url": "https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ABW7xPf7Aas/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAP5s/NsIGvaHahTA/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4/photo.jpg", "rating": 5, "relative_time_description": "2 months ago", "text": "Was not able to go inside or attend a service but the graveyard was open and was very beautiful and peaceful.
