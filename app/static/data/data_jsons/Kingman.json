We try to go whenever we can. it's a great time to just get away from the kids and relax. We've been going for about 6 months, a couple times a month. They have had signs around that's a two-drink minimum on wing night Wednesday. Maybe I was naive but I just thought it was two drink minimum per party since it was always just my boyfriend and I.  tonight when we got there the waitress immediately let us know that when we ordered our drinks she had to charge us for two *per person* I was very confused and thought maybe it was because she was new. I told her that we had been coming to wing night Wednesday now and that has never happened. we ended up telling her that it's fine, we'll take the two drink per person charge. As  I'm there, I kinda  get a little irked because I didn't even need two drinks to begin with. I didn't even finish my first drink. So I never even really got my second drink that I paid for. I asked the waitress if I could speak to the owner. When the owner came by I expressed my past experiences I've never been charged two drinks per visit and he explains to me that that's how they make their money on wing night Wednesday. I suggest maybe raising the price of the Wings or the price of the drinks during wing night or maybe charging for refills because I get he has to make his money but when I asked him how he can charge me for a product that I never really got...  he told me that I must have just lucked out for the past six months because his previous girls weren't doing the their job.. he did offer to take these two extra drinks off of my tab this one time (so orchids to that?) but he told me moving forward that they have to charge me two drinks per visit, even if I only get one.
