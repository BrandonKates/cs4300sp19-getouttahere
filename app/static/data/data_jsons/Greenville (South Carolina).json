Having read the reviews, we were expecting good, uncomplicated food with the risk that service would be slow and inattentive.  We were disappointed on the former, but expectations were met on the latter; the service was bumbling and inefficient.  \n\nThe evening started with a hostess who wasn't sure what to do with our reservation, then migrated to an assistant hostess who didn't know what table to take us to.  While we were waiting, the lead hostess told the group after us, a couple out on an apparent date, that they would have to wait 30+ in the bar for their table -- despite there being two-tops that went unused the entire time we were there.  \n\nWe waited for almost 30 minutes before a waiter greeted us.  He seemed genuinely apologetic and embarrassed, but then wanted to know exactly who we had dealt with and who had shown us to our table so he \"could go talk to them.\"  That should have been dealt with internally and not involved us.  \n\nThe appetizer order was messed up and required a re-firing.  The waiter told us that he was taking it off the bill due to their mistake.  I was surprised to see that they included it on the bill anyway.  An innocent mistake?  Or were they attempting to sneak it past me?  \n\nThe dinners were hit and mix.  Some were good.  Others were not.  One chicken dinner featured chicken meat that was so dry it could have passed for jerky.  One street taco dinner was very tasty.\n\nIn the land of hit and miss, this was a miss.  It strikes me that this is a good idea, but that management/operations have faltered.
