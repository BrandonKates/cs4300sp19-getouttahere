Over the past several years, St. Paul's has become a part of our family; our son was baptized here and we've met some of our closest and dearest friends through the church. \n\nThe programming has met all our needs, but we also see the leadership trying to offer alternatives for those who need something more or something \"different.\" The church is growing and it's got a great vibe. Things are happening, and St. Paul's is instrumental in making them happen in the Clarence community.",

Our class really enjoyed seeing the blacksmith in action and loved getting to touch a couple of \"real live\" farm animals. \nMake sure to check the forecast and dress accordingly (as some of our 2nd graders discovered the hard way). It's all outside, so consider bringing a jacket, sunscreen, bug spray, and a water bottle. Also, DEFINITELY wear some comfy walking shoes because there's lots of that. \nThe only criticism I have is that some of the presentations were given very sloooooowly so the kids struggled a little bit with staying attentive and fidget free. Had the information had been more \"rapid fire\", I feel that there would have been more engagement and therefore, fewer instances of redirection. (Seriously, there was one presentation, that even as an adult, bored *me* to tears. \ud83d\ude34)\nOver all though, we had a really great time and I'd highly recommend the experience!",
