The Senate chamber was locked, but a senator let us in, gave us a personal tour, and then chatted with us for an hour! The Treasury let us into the safe and we got to hold hundreds of thousands of dollars, plus they took our photo for us to download and gave us souvenir coins. The governor's office was super nice and gave us pens, then let us in to tour the office and meet the chief of staff. The entire place was friendly and the building has an elegance that is hard to beat. Plus they have free parking.
